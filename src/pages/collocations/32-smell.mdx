## Story

Today we’ll continue learning collocations related to the five senses, with expressions for describing different smells. Let’s begin by looking at some commonly confused words.

**Aroma, scent,** and **fragrance** all describe a *good* smell. You can talk about the **wonderful aroma** of a cake that has just been taken out of the oven, the **fresh scent** of flowers, and the **sweet fragrance** of a woman’s perfume.

The word **smell** is neutral; you can have the **lovely smell** of fresh-baked bread, or the **horrible smell** of rotting food. The word “smell” can be a noun or a verb – so you can also say **“It smells delicious”** or **“It smells nasty.”**

The words **stench, stink,** and **odor** all describe *bad*smells – there’s the **foul odor** of a dead animal, and the **revolting stench** of sewage. The unpleasant smell of a person who doesn’t take showers or use deodorant is called **body odor.**

To describe the strength of smells, you can say they are **light/faint smells** or **strong smells.** When a smell is extremely strong, you can say it is an **overpowering smell.** A smell that you recognize can be called a **familiar smell,** and a smell that is unique and easy to identify can be called a **distinctive smell** or an **unmistakable smell.**

Smells can “waft” – that means float through the air. For example, the **mouth-watering scent** of chocolate chip cookies wafted across the room. Another verb used with smell is “fill” – the **acrid smell** of smoke filled the hallway. Finally, if a smell stays in a place for a long time, we can use the verb “linger” – the **spicy aroma** of her cooking lingered in the kitchen for hours. 

Here are some additional collocations for describing smells: 

* **earthy/fishy/fruity/metallic smell** – smells like soil/dirt, fish, fruit, or metal 

* **rancid/putrid smell** – a disgusting smell of things that are rotten 

* **damp/dank smell** – a smell of wet things and mold 

* a **pervasive smell** – a smell that tends to fill the space and remain there 

* a **pungent smell** – a smell that is “sharp” and strong; it almost hurts your nose when you smell it

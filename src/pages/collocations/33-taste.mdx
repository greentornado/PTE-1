## Story

Let’s begin this lesson by looking at the commonly confused words **taste** and **flavor.**
The word **taste** is often used as a verb, so you can say that a food **tastes good** or **tastes bad.**If you want to be a little more extreme in your description, you can say that a food **tastes divine/heavenly** _(for an extremely good taste)_ or **tastes gross/disgusting** _(for an extremely bad taste)._

Another expression is “**it tastes funny”** – that means it tastes unusual, with a negative connotation. For example, _“This milk tastes funny – it might be past its expiration date.”_ It’s very common to say that something **tastes like** something else: _“I had frog’s legs once – they **tasted like**chicken.”_

The word **flavor** is typically used as a noun. We can say something has a **nutty, fruity, cheesy, minty,** or **salty flavor** to compare the flavor to another food (nuts, fruit, cheese, etc.) You can also use the word **taste** as a noun – for example: _“This wine has a **fruity taste / fruity flavor.”**_

Flavors or tastes can also be described by category, or by the sensation they cause in your mouth – a **bitter flavor, a sour taste, a sweet taste.** When you enjoy the taste of something, and want to keep it in your mouth for a long time, we say you **savor the taste.**

If a food has a LOT of flavor, then it can be described as **strong** or **rich** – the **strong flavor** of garlic, the **rich flavor** of chocolate. When the level of flavor is low, it is a **mild flavor** or a **subtle flavor.** Both of these words have a positive connotation – \*“This cheese has a nice, **mild flavor”** or, _“The **subtle flavor** of ginger adds a nice touch to this marinade.”_

The expression **bland taste** or **bland flavor** is a way to describe food with little flavor, with a negative connotation. For example – _“These crackers have such a **bland flavor** that it feel like I’m snacking on cardboard.”_

There are some foods that people usually don’t enjoy the first time they try them… but with time, people learn to like the flavor. A food like this can be described as **an acquired taste.**

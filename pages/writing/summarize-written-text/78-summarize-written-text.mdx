## Story

Could midday napping save your life? If the experience of Greek men is any guide, the answer just may be yes.

In a study released yesterday, researchers at Harvard School of public health and in Athens reported that Greeks who took regular 30-minute were 30% less likely to die of heart disease over a six-year period than those who never napped. The scientists tracked more than 23000 adults, finding that the benefits of napping were most pronounced for working men.

Researchers have long recognised that Mediterranean adults die of heart disease at rate lower than Americans and Northern Europeans. Diets rich in olive oil and other heart-healthy food have received some of the credit, but scientists have been intrigued by the potential role of napping. The study, published in the Archives of Internal medicine, concluded that napping was more likely than diet or physical activities to lower the incidence of heart attacks and other life-ending heart ailments. Still, the authors cautioned that further research is needed to confirm their findings.

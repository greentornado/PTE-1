# 22. Crime

## Story

When a person **breaks the law** _(does something illegal)_, we say they have **committed a crime.** Especially horrible crimes – like a **savage rape** or a **brutal murder** – can be described as **barbaric, horrible,** or **vicious crimes.**

If someone tries to commit a crime but does not succeed, we use the word **attempted –** for example, an **attempted murder, attempted kidnapping,** or **attempted break-in.** If someone accuses another person of a crime, but it is not yet proven, then we use the word **alleged**– for example, an **alleged assault, alleged harassment,**or **alleged rape.**

After the victim **reports the crime** to the police, the police will begin to **investigate the crime.** They’ll visit the **crime scene** and **gather forensic evidence** _(collect details like bullets, fingerprints, or blood samples that can show what happened)_. If **witnesses come forward,** the police will interview them to hear a **first-hand account** _(a story told by a person who saw the event)_ of what happened. They also consider possible **motives for the crime**.

Police can **arrest suspects** who they believe have committed a crime – but the suspect can **prove their innocence** by **providing a solid alibi** – that means giving a confirmed explanation of where they were at the time of the crime. If it is never discovered who committed the crime, then the case remains an **unsolved crime.** The statistics about number of crimes in a particular area is called the **crime rate.** And when there is a big increase in the crime rate, we can call this a **crime wave.**

There are also a number of collocations we can use to describe criminals. A **first-time offender** is someone who has broken the law for the first time, whereas someone who has broken the law in the past **has a criminal record.** A criminal who is famous – like a **serial killer** _(a person who has killed multiple people over time)_ or a person who is heavily involved in **organized crime** – can be called a **notorious criminal.**

Collocations for specific crimes / criminals:

- **a cold-blooded killer/murderer** – a person who doesn’t have feeling or emotion
- **a crazed/psychopathic killer** – a killer who is insane or mentally unbalanced
- **domestic violence** – when there is violence inside a home, for example, a husband beating his wife
- **drug trafficking** – the purchase, sale, and transport of illegal drugs
- **identity theft** – when a criminal steals an innocent person’s identifying information and uses it in an illegal way
- **sexual harassment** – when one person makes undesired sexual advances towards another person
- **petty crime** – a minor crime
- **armed robbery** – when criminals steal something, while using weapons

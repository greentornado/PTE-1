# 0. Introduction

In these 50 lessons, you’re going to learn 1000+ collocations that will expand your vocabulary and help your English sound more natural.

Collocations are the typical or common combinations of words we use together.

Here are some simple examples:
  - take a picture 

    ~~do a picture~~

    ~~make a picture~~

  - a quick shower 
    
    ~~a fast shower~~
    
When you make mistakes with collocations, the other person will usually understand you – but your English won’t sound “natural” – because it’s different from the way a native speaker would say it. Although it’s possible to communicate successfully with incorrect collocations, using collocations correctly can help you speak more fluently.

I suggest completing one lesson in this book per day, but of course you can study at your own pace. Always do the quiz after each lesson… this is essential to review and practice what you’ve learned! The answers are at the end of the book.

At the end of each audio file, there’s an opportunity for you to listen to and repeat the collocations. If you’re really short on time, you can skip that part – but it’s nice for practicing your pronunciation, as well as reinforcing the phrase in your memory.

As an additional exercise, I recommend creating your own example sentences with a few of the collocations from each lesson. Try to make them as “personal” as possible, as this helps you remember the expressions better.

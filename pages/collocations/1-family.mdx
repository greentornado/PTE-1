# 1. Family

## Vocabulary

Let’s begin our study of collocations by learning some common expressions about the family. Your parents and siblings (brothers and sisters) are your **immediate family** – and your **extended family** includes all your relatives – uncles, cousins, great-aunts, etc.
You can use a **family tree** to diagram the relationships among your **family members.** A person who is related to you by a long series of connections can be called a **distant relative.**

If you’re lucky, you have a **loving family** or a **close-knit family** – these expressions refer to a family that has good relationships, where everyone loves each other and helps each other. If you were raised in a loving family, then you probably had a **carefree childhood** – that means you had nothing to worry about when you were young.

On the other hand, a family in which the relationships are bad or unhealthy can be called a **dysfunctional family.** If the children experience abuse, poverty, or problems with the law, we can say they had a **troubled childhood.**

Perhaps the parents went through a **bitter divorce** – that means a separation in which there were bad/angry feelings between the husband and wife. It’s also possible to have a **messy divorce,** with a prolonged legal battle involving lots of conflicts about the separation of the former couple’s assets (money and possessions). The decisions about the separation of assets are made in the **divorce settlement.** A family in which there are divorces or separations is sometimes called a **broken home.**

Sometimes the mother and father fight over **custody of the children –** that refers to who has the primary responsibility of caring for the kids. A judge can **grant joint custody** – that means the ex-husband and ex-wife share the responsibility – or **sole custody** to only one parent. For example, a judge might **award sole custody** to the mother, and the father has to **pay child support –** regular payments to help with expenses for the kids.

If it was a **mutual divorce/separation**– that means the ex-husband and ex-wife agreed to separate without fighting – then they will probably stay **on good terms with each other** (meaning to have a polite relationship without conflicts).

If a woman **gets pregnant** without being married or in a relationship, then she will become a **single mother.** Some women in this situation choose to **have an abortion,** and others prefer to **give the baby up for adoption.** The time when the baby is planned to arrive is called the **due date** – you can also say the **baby is due** in mid-October, for example.

After the woman **has the baby** (or **gives birth** to the baby), the baby is given to the **adoptive parents,** who will **raise the child** or **bring up the child** as if it was their own. Sometimes, when the **adopted child** is older, he or she tries to find their **birth mother** (biological mother).

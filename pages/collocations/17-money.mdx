## Story

There are a lot of things you can do with money!
First, you need to **earn money** or **make money** - both of these verbs refer to receiving money from your work. Another way to obtain money is to **inherit money** – receive money from a family member or friend after that person dies. If the person was very rich, you could **inherit a fortune** (a fortune is a lot of money).

You can take your money to the bank and **make a deposit** – put money into your bank account. Later, you can **make a withdrawal** – remove money from your bank account. Of course, everyone likes to **spend money** – use money to buy things – but it’s important not to **waste/squander** your **money.** These verbs refer to using money in a way that’s not productive.

If **money is tight** (meaning you have very little money), you should **make a budget** – a plan for how much to spend on things every month – and then you need to **stick to the budget** (continue following the plan). Otherwise, you might **be broke** by the end of the month! Someone who is “broke” has no money available.

A person who is **financially savvy** (intelligent, perceptive, and well-informed on the subject of money) will always **save money.** It’s a good idea to have an **emergency fund** of at least 3-6 months of **living expenses**(the amount money you use to survive in everyday life). You can also **invest money in the stock market** – you could make a nice profit, but there’s also the risk of **losing money** if the economy goes downhill (starts to get worse).

Let’s say you want to purchase an expensive item like a car. If you haven’t saved up money or **set aside money** for the purchase, you can **borrow money from the bank –** which is also called **taking out a loan.** The disadvantage of this is that you’ll need to **pay the money back in installments** – plus interest (extra money).

When you travel, you’ll need to **change/exchange money** to be able to buy things with the **local currency.** Make sure to change money only at official locations like banks and travel agencies – otherwise, you could be tricked into receiving **counterfeit bills** (false paper money that is not legally valid).

Finally, you can consider **donating money** (giving money without receiving anything in return) to a good cause, such as preserving the environment or researching cures for diseases. Non-profit organizations are always trying to **raise money** (get donations) for their various projects.

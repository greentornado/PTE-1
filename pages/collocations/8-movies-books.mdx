## Story

My brother is a huge fan of movies. When he sees a **movie trailer** _(a short video offering a preview of the movie)_, he counts down the days until **the movie comes out**. He always goes to the **movie theater** on **opening night –** that’s the first day a movie, show, concert, or performance is open to the public. He also loves to analyze the **film critics’ reviews** *(the evaluations of the people whose job is to analyze movies)*and tries to guess which movies will be **nominated for an award.**

One of his favorite **movie stars** _(famous actors/actresses)_ will be **starring in an upcoming film** about the Vietnam War. It’s **based on a true story**, and they’re **shooting the film on-site**in Vietnam – that means they will be recording/filming the movie in the same location as the story occurs.

This particular actor had been talking about retiring, but when he was offered the **leading role** _(the opportunity to play the most important part in a movie)_ in a film that’s sure to be a **box-office hit** _(a movie that is very successful)_ he couldn’t turn it down.

I, on the other hand, prefer books. I’m currently **engrossed in a book** by Stieg Larsson _(the book is taking all my attention)_ – it’s the final part of a trilogy, and I can’t wait to see how things turn out for the **main character** _(the most important person in the book)_. I already have a huge collection of books, and I also **borrow books from the library.**

One book I took out last week deals with modern feminism and motherhood. It’s a bit of a **controversial topic**, but it’s an **interesting and enjoyable read.** I’m not sure I’ll have time to finish it before I have to **return the book to the library.** Maybe I’ll **renew it** for another week – that means to get an extension of the length of time I can keep the book.

**Note:**We talk about the **beginning and end** of a book, story, or film (not the “start and finish”). The first and last parts of a story can also be called the **opening and closing scenes** (in a movie) or the **opening and closing chapters** (in a book).

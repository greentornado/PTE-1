# 10. Sports

## Story
The first important collocation involving sports is when to use the verbs **play, do,** and **go.** We typically use **play** for team sports – you **play soccer, play basketball, play tennis, play baseball,** and **play golf.**

The verb **do** is used for more individual sports – you **do yoga, do gymnastics, do martial arts,**and **do aerobics**. Also, in more general terms, you **do exercise.** Another common individual exercise is to **lift weights.**

The verb **go** is used with most activities that end in –ing: you **go swimming, go biking, go surfing, go rock climbing, go bowling,** and **go fishing.**

With the team sports, we can use the word **game** or **match:** a **soccer game,** a **basketball game,** a **tennis match,**etc. You can **win the game, lose the game,** or **tie the game** – that’s when the **final score** is 1-1 or 2-2, for example. 

A team can play a **home game** – when they play in their own stadium or field – or an **away game** – when they play at the opposing team’s stadium or field. When there are many teams that are playing many games to see which one is the best, we call this a **tournament.**

When one team is winning in the middle of the game – for example, 3-1 – we say that team **has the lead.** However, the other team can **make a comeback** – score points from a losing position – and **take the lead,** 4-3. 

With the sports that use “do” and “go,” we typically use the word **competition** – a **gymnastics competition, a martial arts competition, a surfing competition, an ice skating competition,** etc. The exception is sports where you go from one place to another – like running, biking, and swimming – in that case, we often call the event a **race.**

Athletes /ˈaθliːt/ can **enter a competition** and try to win **first place.** Some athletes try to **enhance their performance** with illegal substances such as steroids /ˈstɛrɔɪd/ . But if they **fail a drug test,** they’ll be disqualified from participating. 

If the athlete is performing well, they may **achieve a personal best** – and if they perform better than ANYONE ever has in the past, then they could even **break the world record** or **set a new world record.** If they get injured, however, they might have to **withdraw from the competition** *(voluntarily leave the competition).*

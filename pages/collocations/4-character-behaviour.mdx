# 4 - Character and Behavior

## Story 
When I was a teenager, I was **painfully shy** *(extremely shy)*. I loved reading books, and I **had a vivid imagination** *(had a creative and colorful imagination)*. My best friend had a more **outgoing personality** *(she liked to be friendly and sociable)* and a good **sense of humor** *(ability to make other people laugh)*. Unfortunately she was also **brutally honest**, and sometimes her comments **hurt my feelings** *(made me sad, upset, or angry)*. 
Although I was **fiercely loyal** to her, she **showed her true colors** *(revealed her true personality)* when she **played a prank** *(did a trick)*that humiliated me in front of the class. I **bore a grudge** *(continued feeling angry)*against her for years afterwards. Now that I look back on it, I can see that she had **low self-esteem** *(she considered herself inferior)*and a bit of **a mean streak** *(a “streak” is a tiny bit of someone’s personality)*. 
I’ve **come out of my shell** *(become less shy)*since those days; I **have a thicker skin** *(I’m less sensitive to criticism)* and it doesn’t bother me when people **speak their minds** *(say exactly what they think, without considering the effects of the words on others)*. 
My biggest flaw is that I **have a tendency** to be arrogant – some say I **have a superiority complex** *(consider myself superior to others)*. I’ll admit that it is hard for me to **swallow my pride** *(stop being arrogant)*and recognize when I’ve been mistaken about something. My resolution for the New Year is to make a more concerted effort to **put others first** *(consider the needs of other people more important than my own).*

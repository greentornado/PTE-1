## Story

My mother radically changed her **eating habits** a few years ago. In the past, she ate a lot of **junk food** _(food that is not nutritious/healthy)_ and was overweight. Sometimes she would try to **go on a diet** _(eat less food and healthier food)_, but it would never last. But now she understands how unhealthy **processed foods** are – they’re full of **food additives** _(chemicals added to food)_ that contribute to weight gain and heart problems.
Nowadays, she eats a **balanced diet** including a lot of **nourishing meals** _(meals that are healthy and nutritious)_ that she prepares herself. She doesn’t buy **organic food** because she thinks the prices are outrageous, but she stocks up on **fresh produce** _(fresh fruits and vegetables)_ so that she can grab an apple or some veggies when she wants a **quick snack** _(something small and fast to eat)_. She has also learned to **eat in moderation** and watch her **portion sizes** _(how much food you take)_.

I often stop by her house when I’m in the mood for a **home-cooked meal.**The other day she made a **hearty stew** _(a thick soup with lots of flavors and ingredients)_ that was full of beans and vegetables. My brother, who has a **healthy appetite** _(the capacity to eat a lot)_, had **a second helping** _(a second portion)_– but I found the stew so filling that I could barely finish my bowl.
My mother recently told me that she’d like to try some **international cuisine.** I was surprised to hear that, because a few years ago she had a bad experience after getting **food poisoning** _(when you get sick because of contaminated food)_ at a Japanese restaurant. So tomorrow I’m taking her to a Brazilian steakhouse. I told her to eat **light meals** _(small meals)_ during the day so that she doesn’t **spoil her appetite** for dinner _(“spoiling your appetite” means eating food earlier, and then not being hungry for a meal later)._

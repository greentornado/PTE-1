# 7. Eating

## Story
My mother radically changed her **eating habits** a few years ago. In the past, she ate a lot of **junk food** *(food that is not nutritious/healthy)* and was overweight. Sometimes she would try to **go on a diet** *(eat less food and healthier food)*, but it would never last. But now she understands how unhealthy **processed foods** are – they’re full of **food additives** *(chemicals added to food)* that contribute to weight gain and heart problems. 
Nowadays, she eats a **balanced diet** including a lot of **nourishing meals** *(meals that are healthy and nutritious)* that she prepares herself. She doesn’t buy **organic food** because she thinks the prices are outrageous, but she stocks up on **fresh produce** *(fresh fruits and vegetables)* so that she can grab an apple or some veggies when she wants a **quick snack** *(something small and fast to eat)*. She has also learned to **eat in moderation** and watch her **portion sizes** *(how much food you take)*.


I often stop by her house when I’m in the mood for a **home-cooked meal.**The other day she made a **hearty stew** *(a thick soup with lots of flavors and ingredients)* that was full of beans and vegetables. My brother, who has a **healthy appetite** *(the capacity to eat a lot)*, had **a second helping** *(a second portion)*– but I found the stew so filling that I could barely finish my bowl. 
My mother recently told me that she’d like to try some **international cuisine.** I was surprised to hear that, because a few years ago she had a bad experience after getting **food poisoning** *(when you get sick because of contaminated food)* at a Japanese restaurant. So tomorrow I’m taking her to a Brazilian steakhouse. I told her to eat **light meals** *(small meals)* during the day so that she doesn’t **spoil her appetite** for dinner *(“spoiling your appetite” means eating food earlier, and then not being hungry for a meal later).*

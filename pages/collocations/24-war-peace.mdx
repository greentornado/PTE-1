# 24. War & Peace

## Story

When a war begins, we can say that **war has broken out** or **violence has erupted** in the region. When one country officially enters into a state of war, then they have **declared war** on the enemy country.

Sometimes, one country performs a **pre-emptive strike** _(an early attack)_ against another – for example, if it suspects that the other country is **stockpiling weapons** _(creating a collection of weapons)_ that will be used for a future attack. The other country may view this as an **unprovoked attack** _(an unfair attack without a reason)_, and **tensions may rise** until the area is **on the brink of war** – meaning that war is very probable.

Sending in the military is often called **deploying troops.** The soldiers may **be stationed/posted** in a certain area to protect it, or they may **launch an offensive** in which they **storm/invade enemy territory.** When the soldiers begin firing their guns, we say that they **opened fire.**

Unfortunately, the **horrors of war** affect everyone, as innocent people are always **caught in the crossfire** _(in the middle of the violence without participating in it)_. Both sides are sure to **suffer civilian casualties** _(when innocent people are injured or killed)_ and there will be **collateral damage** to the countries’ infrastructure. War also results in many **refugees displaced** by the violence; they may **resettle** in another area or **flee** to another country.

If a particular battle was an important turning point in the war, then it is called a **decisive battle.** Sometimes another country intervenes and helps the two sides **negotiate a truce/ceasefire** _(agree to stop fighting)_. If successful, this can **restore peace** – but it may be a **fragile/uneasy peace.** More work will still be needed to **bring stability** to the area and establish a **lasting peace.** Often, **peacekeeping forces** remain in the region to try to **avert war** _(avoid war)._

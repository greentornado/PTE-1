## Story

Before you begin writing a paper, it’s a good idea to **make an outline** *(a list of points in an organized order)*of the **main points** you plan to present. The next step is to **gather evidence** to **support your claims,** since your work won’t be credible if you **propose a theory** (or try to **challenge** or **refute a theory –** argue against an existing theory) without some proof.

If your paper is going to **touch on several issues** _(talk about several topics)_ then you’ll need to be especially organized. You can **draw a distinction** between topics that are different, or **draw parallels** between examples that are similar. Another way to organize your ideas is to show how they **fall into different categories.**

After making your outline and gathering the supporting evidence you’ll use to **make your case** _(present your argument)_, you can write a **first draft** _(first version of the paper)_ in which you **go into detail** on the topic. Then, you **revise the paper** _(make improvements to it)_ until finishing with the **final draft.**

Let’s say you’re **carrying out a study** on market trends in developing countries. You can analyze the **key factors** _(important factors)_ that are influencing the economy, showing how local politics **play a role/part** _(have an effect)_ in shaping the country’s financial future. Including some specific items that are **perfect examples** and **clear illustrations** of your ideas will help **prove your points.**

At the end of your paper, you should **briefly summarize** the material you presented and **draw conclusions** based on your research. The end of the article is also a good place to **raise questions** _(present questions)_ for further study.

## Story

Today you’re going to expand your vocabulary by learning various collocations about colors.

You can describe a color as **light** or **dark** – for example, someone can have **light brown** or **dark brown** hair. If a color is very intense, you can describe it as **bright** – for example, a **bright red** apple. If the color is not very intense, you can describe it as **pale** – for example, a **pale green** dress.

When describing colors in general, you can talk about **bold/vivid colors –** which are very intense – or **pastel colors,** which are light or pale.

We can use other words to describe specific **shades of a color** _(variations of a specific color)._ These words are usually a typical object with that particular color. For example, _“sky blue”_ is a light shade of blue, like the color of the sky. Here are some of the most common collocations:

- **ruby red**
- **cherry red**
- **fiery orange**
- **burnt orange**
- **lemon yellow**
- **golden yellow**
- **emerald green**
- **olive green**
- **sky blue**
- **royal blue**
- **navy blue / midnight blue**

When you have something that is primarily one color, but with a little bit of another color included, we can use the word “tinge.” There are two ways to structure the sentence:

The flowers are yellow with a **tinge of pink** in the middle. 

My cat’s fur is light gray with a slight **brownish tinge.**

You can also use this form – a color word plus –ISH – to describe mixes of colors. For example, **“reddish brown”** is a shade of brown with a strong portion of red, whereas **“yellowish brown”**i s a shade of brown with a strong portion of yellow.

Some colors look good together – in this case, we can say that **the colors match.** Other colors look terrible together – in this case, we can say that **the colors clash.** When the color of a person’s clothes looks good with that person’s **skin tone** _(color of their skin),_ you can say **“that color suits you”** or **“that color looks good on you.”**
  
  Finally, one tip about changing the color of something. We use the verb “paint” in most cases – you **paint a house** and **paint your nails.** But we use the verb “dye” for hair and cloth/fabric – so you **dye your hair blonde** and **dye a shirt blue.**

_Circle the correct word to complete this commentary from a reporter at a fashion show._
Cassandra is wearing a **fiery / flaming** orange blouse and a **king / royal** blue skirt - those certainly are very **bold / brave** colors! Here comes Susan, wearing a long, **fair / light** pink dress and **navy / ruby** red heels. Those **pastel / pasty** colors look wonderful with her skin tone / type.

The designer of the next outfit is known for his highly innovative style… Joanne is wearing an **ember / emerald** green top and **cherry / olive** green shorts - hmmm… in my opinion the two different **shades / tinges** of green don’t look so great together. They kind of **clash / dye**.

Up next is Tanya, with a retro-style **greenest/greenish** - blue dress with some **lemon / lime** yellow details - very interesting look, although the colors might not **match / suit** everybody. Finally we have Ashley, who’s wearing a sexy **burnt / dark** purple dress with a **golden / silvery** yellow belt, a **combining / matching** purse, and **cloud / sky** blue heels - that’s quite unusual, but the overall visual effect is stunning.

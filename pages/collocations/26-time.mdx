# 26. Time

## Story

Are you always **in a rush,** or do you **take your time?** Do you **spend your time** efficiently, or do you **waste time** and procrastinate important tasks – then stay up working until **ungodly hours** *(very late at night/early in the morning)*?

It has **taken me ages** *(taken a very long time)*, but I’ve finally adopted some **time-management** habits: 

- Plan things **well in advance** and don’t underestimate the **amount of time** things will take – otherwise you’ll end up being a slave to your **grueling schedule** *(very intense schedule).*

- Take care of **time-consuming tasks** *(things that take a lot of time)*on a day when you have no **pressing commitments** *(urgent appointments or things to do).*

- **Establish a timeline** for major projects, so that you don’t **leave things to the last minute** and risk **running out of time.** Then, **stick to the schedule** and try to **get ahead** if possible. There’s nothing worse than **falling behind** on a project with a **strict deadline** *(a definite date before which it needs to be finished).*

- Leave home and work a little earlier than normal to avoid **rush hour** *(the time when there is a lot of traffic because everyone is going to work or coming home from work).*
- Sleep for **eight solid hours** *(eight hours without interruption)* every night; you’ll wake up with more energy. 

If you’re working **from dawn till dusk** *(from the early morning to the late evening)* and you have little or no **spare/free time,** it could mean that you’re overworked, and you should **cut back on your hours** *(reduce your working hours)* to **free up some time** *(make more time available).*

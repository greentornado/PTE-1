# 21. Countryside

## Story

If you’re living in an urban area and looking for a little **change of scenery,** why not take a weekend trip to the **surrounding countryside**? You can walk through the **wildlife preserve** (*special area where animals are protected)*, where a **winding footpath** *(a road you can walk on, that has many turns and changes of direction)* will lead you through **varied landscapes** including **dense forests, vast meadows,** and **gentle, rolling hills.**

More adventurous visitors will enjoy exploring the **rocky landscape** of Yosemite National Park with its **towering cliffs** *(very tall cliffs)* and **magnificent waterfalls**. You can take a **hiking trail** that goes up the **steepest face of the tallest mountain** in the park *(the side of a mountain is called a “face” – and “steep” means it is very vertical)*. The trail starts at the **foot of the mountain** *(the base of the mountain)* and the ascent takes about four hours; you can stop to have lunch on the banks of a **clear, bubbling mountain stream.**

From the summit, there’s a **spectacular panoramic view** *(meaning you can see in all directions)* of the area. To the East, you can see the **jagged, snow-covered peaks** of a **distant mountain range** *(a group or chain of mountains)*; you can gaze at the **lush green countryside** *(an area with lots of healthy vegetation)* to the south, and when looking west, you can see the **slow-moving, shallow river** *(a river that is not very deep or fast)* that flows lazily towards the oceans. 

The coastline is just a three-hour drive from the mountains, with miles of **sun-drenched, sandy beaches**. You can stay overnight at a family-run hotel in the **picturesque fishing village** *(beautiful, good for taking pictures)*, where every room has an **unobstructed view** *(there are no obstacles blocking the view)* of the sea. The beaches tend to get crowded in the summer, so one option is to take a **boat trip** across the bay and explore the **secluded beaches** *(beaches that are hidden)* on the island – **it’s well worth the trip** *(meaning it’s a good use of your time to go there).*

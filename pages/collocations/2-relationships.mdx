# 2. Relationships

## Story
When you move to a new city, it can be hard to **make friends.** You’ll probably have a number of **casual acquaintances** – people who you know on a basic level, but with whom you don’t have a significant relationship. Over time, some of these may become **good friends** or **close friends** – these collocations refer to friends with whom you have an especially strong relationship. 

Do you believe in **love at first sight?** That’s when two people meet each other and immediately **fall in love** – perhaps because they have **strong chemistry** – this expression describes strong compatibility or connection between two possible romantic partners. Some people believe that their **significant other** (their boyfriend, girlfriend, husband, or wife) is their **soul mate** – this is a poetic expression that means that two people are destined to be together. 

It’s possible for one person to **have feelings for** another person – this expression is an indirect way to describe *romantic* feelings – but if the other person doesn’t feel the same way, then **the feeling is not mutual.** The other person might say **“he’s/she’s just not my type”** – meaning that they are interested in people of a different type of personality/appearance. Ah, there’s nothing sadder than **unrequited love!** (Love that is not returned) 

Some people marry their **childhood sweetheart** or **high school/college sweetheart** – this expression refers to a boyfriend or girlfriend from your childhood, teenage, or college years. Other couples are introduced by a **mutual friend** – one friend that the two people have in common. When the couple is ready to **make a commitment,** the man **proposes to the woman** – he asks her to marry him. If the marriage is good, then we say the couple is **happily married.**

Unfortunately, not all love stories have a happy ending. Sometimes a husband or wife **has an affair –** they have sex with a different person. We can also say that they are **cheating on their husband/wife.** The expression “have an affair” is typically used only for married couples, and the expression “cheating on” can be used for married couples or for boyfriends/girlfriends.

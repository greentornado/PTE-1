# 29. Light

## Story

We use the expression **“the sun is shining”** to talk about the sun emitting light. If the light is so strong that it’s difficult to see, we can describe it as **blinding sunlight –** and if the light is not very strong, then it is **weak sunlight.**

When the **sun sets** _(disappears below the horizon),_ everything **grows dark.** If there’s a **full moon,** then there will still be some light. But if there’s a **crescent moon** or a **new moon,** then it will be **pitch dark/black** _(completely black)_ and you’ll be able to see the **stars twinkling** in the night sky.

To describe the strength of a light, you can use the words _“bright”_ and _“dim.”_ A **fluorescent light bulb** emits **bright light,** and the **faint glow** of a **flickering candle** is **dim light.** When light shines on an object, it makes the object **cast a shadow.** An area that protected from the sunlight is often called _“the shade.”_ If you don’t want to get sunburned, it’s a good idea to **sit in the shade.**

We use the word _“lighting”_ to refer to a system of artificial lights, especially inside a house or building. A place can have **bright/strong lighting** or the opposite – **soft/subdued lighting** _(a low level of illumination for artistic/romantic purposes)_. And along the highways and roads, we have **street lights.**

If it’s nighttime and the **power goes out** (or there is a **power outage** – a lack of electrical power), then the city will be **plunged into darkness.** You can describe the darkness as **complete/total darkness** to emphasize that it is 100% dark. People will have to use flashlights or **light candles** to be able to see – until the next morning when the **sun rises/comes up**.

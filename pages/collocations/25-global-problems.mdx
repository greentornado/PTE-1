# 25. Global Problems

## Story

In today’s lesson, we’ll focus on several major global problems.
One critical issue is **preserving** and **protecting the environment.** The burning of **fossil fuels** _(oil, coal, and natural gas)_ produces **greenhouse gases** *(gases that heat up the atmosphere)*t hat **deplete the ozone layer** and result in **global warming** and **climate change** _(changes in the earth’s temperature and weather patterns)_.

Some scientists believe that we have already **done irreparable damage** to the planet, and now we are suffering the consequences of **rising sea levels** and increasingly frequent **natural disasters** such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and tornados. A number of **animal species have gone extinct,**and many more are **endangered.** To reverse this trend, we must invest in **clean energy** _(energy sources that do not pollute the environment)_ with **renewable resources** _(elements like water and air, which can be re-used)_ and utilize manufacturing methods that are not **harmful to the environment.**

There are still many regions of the world where children **die of hunger/starvation** _(die from not having enough food)_. Unfortunately, **extreme poverty** is common in the rural areas of **developing countries,** where the population often suffers from **food shortages** *(not enough food)*and **lack of access to clean water.**

In the cities, **homeless people** sleep on the streets if there is not enough room in local **homeless shelters**. There are also many families **on the margins of society** _(outside the dominant society and culture)_ who are **living below the poverty line** and struggle to make ends meet every month. Although many governments create **welfare programs** _(programs that give money to poor people)_ to **alleviate poverty,** the widening gap between rich and poor suggests that poverty may never be completely eradicated.

Poverty and underdevelopment contribute to a host of additional problems as well. For example, many people die of **preventable diseases** because they have no access the **safe and effective vaccines** that exist. A number of large corporations use **child labor** in the manufacturing of their products, as poor families may feel they have no other option for survival. In addition, young women from **disadvantaged backgrounds** _(poor families and situations)_ are prime targets for **human trafficking** and **sexual exploitation.**

**Jim:** If I’m elected, my number one priority will be <input className="input small-input"/> poverty. A large portion of our country’s population lives below the poverty <input className="input small-input"/>, and it’s a fact that young people from <input className="input small-input"/> backgrounds are more likely to engage in criminal activity. My opponent, on the other hand, wants to cut funding for the <input className="input small-input"/> program and leave millions of people without help.

**George:** I believe it is a mistake to focus on our country alone; we must remember that we are part of a global community. Opening up more homeless <input className="input small-input"/> is not a long-term solution to help those on the <input className="input small-input"/> of society. However, investing in <input className="input small-input"/> energy will enable us to grow our economy without <input className="input small-input"/> the environment. This will benefit our country and our world.

**Jim:** That’s a noble goal, but we have more pressing problems. I seriously doubt our citizens who are dying of <input className="input small-input"/> care about protecting <input className="input small-input"/> species and preventing global <input className="input small-input"/>. Plus, it’s not scientifically proven that humans can even cause <input className="input small-input"/> damage to the planet.

**George:** Don’t you see that the two issues are related? Due to <input className="input small-input"/> change, the rain patterns have changed and our agricultural sector is not as strong as it once was. This results in food <input className="input small-input"/>. It’s only going to get worse unless we end our dependence on <input className="input small-input"/> fuels and start using <input className="input small-input"/> resources.

## Answer

**Jim:** If I’m elected, my number one priority will be **alleviating** poverty. A large portion of our country’s population lives below the poverty **line**, and it’s a fact that young people from **disadvantaged** backgrounds are more likely to engage in criminal activity. My opponent, on the other hand, wants to cut funding for the **welfare** program and leave millions of people without help.

**George:** I believe it is a mistake to focus on our country alone; we must remember that we are part of a global community. Opening up more homeless **shelters** is not a long-term solution to help those on the **margins** of society. However, investing in **clean** energy will enable us to grow our economy without **harming** the environment. This will benefit our country and our world.
**Jim:** That’s a noble goal, but we have more pressing problems. I seriously doubt our citizens who are dying of **hunger** care about protecting **endangered** species and preventing global **warming**. Plus, it’s not scientifically proven that humans can even cause **irreparable** damage to the planet.

**George:** Don’t you see that the two issues are related? Due to **climate** change, the rain patterns have changed and our agricultural sector is not as strong as it once was. This results in food **shortages**. It’s only going to get worse unless we end our dependence on **fossil** fuels and start using **renewable** resources.

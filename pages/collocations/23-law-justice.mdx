# 23. Law/Justice

## Story

The government is responsible for **passing laws** _(approving new laws to be put into practice)_, and the courts and legal system are in charge of **upholding** and **enforcing the law** _(applying the law to the population)_.

When a person is **charged with a crime** _(formally accused of the crime)_, he or she must **appear in court** to **stand trial** _(be judged guilty or innocent)_. Both the prosecution and the defense will present their cases before the judge and jury. After consideration, the judge or jury will **reach a verdict** _(arrive at a decision)._

If there is **irrefutable, overwhelming,** or **concrete evidence,** this means that it is very obvious that the person committed the crime, and it’s possible that the **jury will be unanimous** _(meaning they all agree)_ in their decision. However, if the **evidence is circumstantial or inconclusive** _(the evidence does not 100% prove the conclusion)_, then the decision will be more difficult – it’s possible to have a **hung jury,** which cannot agree on the verdict.

Less serious crimes will receive a **light sentence** _(a small punishment)_ – for example, the offender may have to **pay a fine** or **do community service.** For more serious crimes, the person will probably **go to prison** – and especially heinous crimes can result in a **harsh sentence** such as **life in prison** (or **life imprisonment**) or, in some places, the **death penalty.**

After the decision is made, the lawyers can choose to **appeal the verdict** _(try to change the decision)_, and the case may turn into a **prolonged legal battle** as the courts decide whether to **uphold** or **overturn the original verdict** – _“uphold”_ meaning to continue with the original decision, and _“overturn”_ meaning to change the decision.

As a **convicted criminal** is **serving time** _(spending time in prison)_, he or she should remember the possibility of being **released from prison** early for **good behavior,** as long as they are not deemed a **threat to society** _(possibly dangerous to other people)_.

A criminal who is released early is said to be **_“on parole,”_** meaning that he or she must comply with certain conditions after getting out of jail – such as getting a job and refraining from drug/alcohol use.

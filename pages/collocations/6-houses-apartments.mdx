# 6. Houses and Apartments

## Story
I recently spent a month on vacation – but instead of staying in a hotel, I looked for a **short-term rental** *(a place to live that can be rented for a short period of time)*.  I ended up sharing a **two-bedroom apartment** – that’s an apartment with two bedrooms, a living room, and a kitchen – with some friends. It was actually cheaper than renting a **studio apartment** *(an apartment with only one big room)*all by myself.

The apartment was on the top floor of a **five-story building** *(that’s a building with five floors)* and it had a balcony **overlooking the ocean** *(that means you can see the ocean from the balcony).* From the roof, we also **had a nice view of** the city skyline *(this is another expression used when you can see something from a certain place).*
The apartment had **recently been remodeled/renovated** – meaning it was fixed up and improved – and was **fully furnished,** so it already had furniture (beds, tables, etc.) and appliances (refrigerator, stove, etc.)

We loved the **spacious living room** *(the room was big),* but unfortunately **the bedrooms were rather cramped** *(small and uncomfortable).* It was nice to spend a month there, but by the end of the trip I started to **feel homesick** – that’s when you feel sad because you miss your life at home. 
I’d really like to **have a place of my own** so that I’m not throwing away money on rent every month, but there’s a real shortage of **affordable housing** *(houses/apartments that are reasonably priced)* in my city. Even if I stay away from the **upscale neighborhoods** *(areas where rich people live),*I’d still have to **take out a mortgage** *(borrow money from the bank, in order to buy a house)* and it’ll take me more than 30 years to **pay it off.**

But still, I’m gonna start saving up for a **down payment** *(an initial payment on a big purchase).* Someday, when I do **move into a new place,** I’ll be sure to **throw a housewarming party** *(a party to celebrate living in a new house/apartment).*

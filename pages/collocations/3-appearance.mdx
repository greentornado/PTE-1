## Story

My best friend Joanna is **absolutely gorgeous** _(extremely beautiful)._ She has **long, sleek, jet-black hair** _(sleek = smooth and straight, jet-black = perfectly black),_ **pale blue eyes** _(pale = light color_), and **a radiant complexion** _(skin that appears healthy and full of energy)._

People always compliment her on her **hourglass figure** _(when a woman has large breasts and hips, but a small waist)_ and ask her what the secret is to maintaining such a **slender waist** _(a thin waist)._ She has a **round face** with an **upturned nose**, and she actually **bears a striking resemblance** _(looks extremely similar)_ **to** a famous singer.

Joanna could get any guy she wanted – so I was really surprised when she introduced me to her latest boyfriend, who I think is **hideously ugly**. He has **curly, shoulder-length hair** that looks rather **unkempt** _(unkempt hair = messy hair, it appears that the person doesn’t take care of their hair)_.

He has a **square face** and a **ruddy complexion** _(reddish skin)_. His **deep-set eyes** _(eyes that are far back in the person’s face)_ are almost hidden under his **bushy eyebrows** _(big eyebrows with lots of hair)_, and he sports a **thick mustache** and a huge, **shaggy beard** _(a beard with lots of hair)_. I guess Joanna doesn’t mind his **facial hair** _(facial hair = beard and/or mustache)_.

His body isn’t bad – he has an **athletic build** _(body with a lot of muscles)_, with **broad shoulders** _(wide shoulders)_ and **muscular arms.** If he would only **trim his beard** _(cut his beard a little shorter)_ and **comb his hair,** I suppose he could be considered **somewhat attractive** _(more or less beautiful/handsome)._

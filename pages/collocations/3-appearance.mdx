# 3. Appearance

## Story
My best friend Joanna is **absolutely gorgeous** *(extremely beautiful).* She has **long, sleek, jet-black hair** *(sleek = smooth and straight, jet-black = perfectly black),* **pale blue eyes** *(pale = light color*), and **a radiant complexion** *(skin that appears healthy and full of energy).*

People always compliment her on her **hourglass figure** *(when a woman has large breasts and hips, but a small waist)* and ask her what the secret is to maintaining such a **slender waist** *(a thin waist).* She has a **round face** with an **upturned nose**, and she actually **bears a striking resemblance** *(looks extremely similar)* **to** a famous singer. 

Joanna could get any guy she wanted – so I was really surprised when she introduced me to her latest boyfriend, who I think is **hideously ugly**. He has **curly, shoulder-length hair** that looks rather **unkempt** *(unkempt hair = messy hair, it appears that the person doesn’t take care of their hair)*.
He has a **square face** and a **ruddy complexion** *(reddish skin)*. His **deep-set eyes** (eyes that are far back in the person’s face)* are almost hidden under his **bushy eyebrows** *(big eyebrows with lots of hair)*, and he sports a **thick mustache** and a huge, **shaggy beard** *(a beard with lots of hair)*. I guess Joanna doesn’t mind his **facial hair** *(facial hair = beard and/or mustache)*. 
His body isn’t bad – he has an **athletic build** *(body with a lot of muscles)*, with **broad shoulders** *(wide shoulders)* and **muscular arms.** If he would only **trim his beard** *(cut his beard a little shorter)* and **comb his hair,** I suppose he could be considered **somewhat attractive** *(more or less beautiful/handsome).*

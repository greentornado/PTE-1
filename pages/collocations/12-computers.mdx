# 12. Computers

## Story

I’m teaching my grandmother how to use a computer. First I showed her how to **start up** and **shut down the computer**. Then, I helped her **get online** or **access the internet** so that she can **check her e-mail.** She quickly learned how to **write and send messages, reply to an e-mail** and **forward an e-mail** _(send a complete e-mail that you received to a new person)_, but it was a little hard for her to remember how to **attach a file** to an outgoing message.

We tried to **log into her bank account** online, but the bank’s **website was down** _(the website was not functional, or was not online)_. There was a notice on the **home page** *(the main page of the website)*that they were doing some **scheduled maintenance** on the system **–** so we’ll try again tomorrow.

This afternoon, I’ll teach her how to use a **search engine.** I think she’ll really enjoy **surfing/browsing the web** *(exploring the internet)*and using **social media.** If she needs to do something more advanced, like **burn a CD** _(put files from a computer onto a CD)_, then I can do that for her.

She’s a little bit afraid of **pressing the wrong key** and accidentally **deleting an important file,** but I told her that we can always **recover the file** from the recycling bin. I also explained that if **the computer freezes** or **locks up** _(stops moving/functioning)_ , **she can simply **restart/reboot the computer.\*\*

It’s also a good idea for her to **back up her files** *(make an extra copy of the information)*so that she doesn’t lose her data if the **computer crashes** _(the computer breaks)_ and can’t be repaired. I **installed a program** that periodically **runs scans for viruses and spyware** to ensure that her computer hasn’t been **infected.**

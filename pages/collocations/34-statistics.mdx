# 34. Statistics

## Story

First, let’s clarify the difference between ***“number”*** and ***“amount”*** – we use ***“number”*** with countable nouns, and ***“amount”*** with uncountable nouns.

* A **large number** of people
* A **massive amount** of damage
* A **significant number** of countries
* A **considerable amount** of money
* A **tiny number** of computers
* A **miniscule amount** of alcohol

Numbers and statistics can ***increase*** or ***decrease*** *(more formal)*, ***rise*** or ***fall*** *(also formal)* or ***go up** *and ***go dow*n** *(more informally)*. When a number goes up or down very fast, we can describe this as **sharp or dramatic** – for example, the sudden improvement in the economy has resulted in a **dramatic drop** in unemployment and a **sharp rise** in consumer spending. When a number goes up or down slowly, then we can talk about a **gradual increase** in population or a **slow decline** in the number of violent crimes. And if a number doesn’t change, then it **remains steady** or **remains constant.**

We use the word ***“widespread”*** to describe something that is happening frequently in many places. For example, there being **widespread dissatisfaction** with the government, or a new book winning **widespread acclaim** in the literary world. A hurricane can cause **widespread damage,** and a presidential candidate can have **widespread support** among voters of a certain demographic.

In conversational English, we often use the structure ***keep + -ING*** to describe something that happens frequently. For example,

* *“I’m trying to work, but my colleagues **keep interrupting** me.*” 
* *“Why do you **keep asking** me about the problem? I’ve told you a thousand times I don’t know how to solve it.”*

The **heavy / sharp** rise in obesity is a major cause for concern.

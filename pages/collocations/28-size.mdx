# 28. Size

## Story

This lesson will help clarify when to use the confusing words **big, small, large, little, tall, short, high,** and **low.** Often, the only difference between them is in their collocations.

_“Big”_ is much more common than _“large.”_ The word _“large”_ is a little more formal, but in many sentences, it makes no difference: She lives in a **big** house. = She lives in a **large** house.
So let’s focus on the collocations in which **large**is almost always used – knowing that you can use “big” for other objects. We tend to use **large** with drink sizes – a **large coffee,** a **large soda –** as well as with clothing sizes – small, medium, and large.

**Large** is usually used with words referring to statistics and measurements, such as **quantity, number, amount, increase,** and **proportion.** We say:

- A **large number** of students enrolled in the course.
- ~~A **big number** of students enrolled in the course.~~

We also use the expressions _“large scale”_ and _“small scale”_ to refer to the size of an operation; for example, _“The factory began **large-scale** production of automotive parts.”_

There are a number of collocations in which we _must_ use “big” and we cannot use “_large.”_ These include situations and events, for example: **a big accomplishment, a big decision, a big disappointment, a big failure, a big improvement, a big mistake,** and **a big surprise.** You can also use the informal expressions **big brother** and **big sister** to refer to a sibling who is older than you.

The words _“tall”_ and _“short”_ are used for physical objects, and refer to the total height from the bottom to the top. So we talk about a **tall building, tall trees,** and a **tall man/woman.** The words _“high”_ and _“low”_ refer to distance above the ground – so we say that an airplane is flying 10,000 feet high, or that an apple is on a low branch of a tree.

**High** and **low** are also used with non-physical things, especially those which have different _“levels”_:

- high/low prices
- high/low levels
- high/low quality
- high/low rate
- high/low degree

Finally, let’s tackle _“small”_ and _“little.”_ The word _“little”_ can imply that you feel some affection or sympathy for the object, whereas the word _“small”_ is neutral. Thus, _“little”_ often appears together with adjectives like **nice, cute, pretty, poor,** and **tiny.**

- She lives in a **small house.**
- She lives in a **cute little house.**
- They have three **small children.**
- They have three **pretty little girls.**
- We adopted a **small dog.**
- We adopted a **poor little dog** that had been abandoned in the park.

Another difference is that the word _“small”_ usually refers to physical size, whereas the word “little” can refer to quantity – it means _“not very much”_ and is the opposite of _“a lot”_:

For example, we can say:

- I made **a little money** from a temporary job. (not _“small money”_)
- I **slept very little** last night. (not _“slept very small”_)
- There’s **little salt** in this food. (not _“small salt”_)

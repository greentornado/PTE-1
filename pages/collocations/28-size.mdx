# 28. Size

## Story

This lesson will help clarify when to use the confusing words **big, small, large, little, tall, short, high,** and **low.** Often, the only difference between them is in their collocations.

*“Big”* is much more common than *“large.”* The word *“large”* is a little more formal, but in many sentences, it makes no difference: She lives in a **big** house. = She lives in a **large** house. 
So let’s focus on the collocations in which **large**is almost always used – knowing that you can use “big” for other objects. We tend to use **large** with drink sizes – a **large coffee,** a **large soda –** as well as with clothing sizes – small, medium, and large. 

**Large** is usually used with words referring to statistics and measurements, such as **quantity, number, amount, increase,** and **proportion.** We say: 

* A **large number** of students enrolled in the course. 
* ~~A **big number** of students enrolled in the course.~~ 

We also use the expressions *“large scale”* and *“small scale”* to refer to the size of an operation; for example, *“The factory began **large-scale** production of automotive parts.”*

There are a number of collocations in which we *must* use “big” and we cannot use “*large.”* These include situations and events, for example: **a big accomplishment, a big decision, a big disappointment, a big failure, a big improvement, a big mistake,** and **a big surprise.** You can also use the informal expressions **big brother** and **big sister** to refer to a sibling who is older than you.

The words *“tall”* and *“short”* are used for physical objects, and refer to the total height from the bottom to the top. So we talk about a **tall building, tall trees,**and a **tall man/woman.** The words *“high”* and *“low”* refer to distance above the ground – so we say that an airplane is flying 10,000 feet high, or that an apple is on a low branch of a tree. 

**High** and **low** are also used with non-physical things, especially those which have different *“levels”*: 

* high/low prices 
* high/low levels 
* high/low quality 
* high/low rate 
* high/low degree 

Finally, let’s tackle *“small”* and *“little.”* The word *“little”* can imply that you feel some affection or sympathy for the object, whereas the word *“small”* is neutral. Thus, *“little”* often appears together with adjectives like **nice, cute, pretty, poor,** and **tiny.**

* She lives in a **small house.**
* She lives in a **cute little house.**
* They have three **small children.**
* They have three **pretty little girls.**
* We adopted a **small dog.**
* We adopted a **poor little dog** that had been abandoned in the park. 

Another difference is that the word *“small”* usually refers to physical size, whereas the word “little” can refer to quantity – it means *“not very much”* and is the opposite of *“a lot”*: 

For example, we can say:

* I made **a little money** from a temporary job. (not *“small money”*) 
* I **slept very little** last night. (not *“slept very small”*) 
* There’s **little salt** in this food. (not *“small salt”*)

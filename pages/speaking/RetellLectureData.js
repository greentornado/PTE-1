    topic: 'Australian Cities',
    transcript: [`Australia’s location is important for the world’s exports, and its international trade is also important. Since Australia has a large territory with vast uninhabited areas, all towns are scattered around. This leads to huge expenses for transportation when using trains and ferries. The government also have to pay large amounts for its telecommunications to build up the catching between these regions. The Australian people are mainly living in five cities: Melbourne, Sydney, Perth and Brisbane and Adelaide The most special one is Perth, which is one of the most isolated cities in the world .However, this does not affect its state to be one of the largest cities in Australia. Most large companies, like the two leading companies, Telstra and Qantas, they are both based in Perth.`],

    topic: 'Sigmund Freud',
    transcript: [`For better or worse, we live in a world profoundly affected by Sigmund Freud. If I had to ask you, choose a psycho…, no, name a famous psychologist, the answer of most of you would be Freud. He's the most famous psychologist ever and he's had a profound influence on the 20th and 21st century. Some biographical information: he was born in the 1850s; he spent most of his life in Vienna, Austria. And ah … but he died in London. He escaped to London soon after retreating there at the beginning of World War Two as the Nazis began to occupy where he lived. He’s one of the most famous scholars ever, but he's not known for any single discovery. Instead he's known for the development of an encompassing theory of mind, one that he developed over the span of many decades.`],

    topic: 'Climate Change',
    transcript: [`Some adverse effects of climate changes change agricultural production. Some lands are just merely unsuitable for growing crops. There will be millions of people facing hunger in Africa in the near future. Climate change will result in less production and less food it is difficult for developing countries to deal with climate change due to their financial status and other issues. There are many people living in hunger, especially in Africa. The climate change has devastating effects on world economy. The tropical areas on earth are dry and hot and are originally not suitable for food production. The change of climate leads to extreme weather conditions such as floods and hurricanes which exacerbates the food production issues. As a result, it leads to a continuous decline in food supply annually around 10 to 17 percent and this trend is perceived to be continuing in the future by 2070. The regions suffering the most will be some African countries.`],

    topic: 'Black Hole',
    transcript: [`This simulation shows what you might see if you are orbiting a black hole. The light and position of background stars around the whole are distorted by its gravity and they seem to spin around. On the right, the constellation Orion appears to approach the event horizon, the boundary from which nothing can escape. Orion stars look like they become separated and get spun around. Once the hole has passed by, Orion reappears on the left and looks normal again. Users can also experiment with different scenarios. This is what you might see if you were traveling towards a black hole with rocket engines slowing your descent. Another simulation mimics free fall into a hole. In the middle, the light of the entire universe appears to be concentrated in a bright ring.`],

    transcript: [
      `When you think of a leader, you may think of an individual who is above all bold. But a new study of fish called sticklebacks shows that shy individuals actually prefer to follow fish that are similarly timid.`, `Researchers had trios of sticklebacks with known personalities play follow the leader. The fish were placed in a tank that had some plastic plants at one end and some food hidden at the other. In some of the groups, a bold fish and a shy fish acted as leaders, while another shy fish followed. And in other groups, it was a bold fish that did the following. The researchers recorded whether the follower sallied forth more frequently with the fish that was behaviorally similar or the one that was different. What they found is that shy fish were more likely to emerge from under cover when an equally wary fellow was already out there. Bold follower fish did not seem to care which leader they followed. Of course, no matter which fish a stickleback chose to stick with, the bold fish did lead more expeditions over the course of the experiment than their more retiring friends. That’s because the bold fish initiated more trips, regardless of who might be tailing them. The findings are in the journal Biology Letters.`, `The researchers write that “when offered a choice of leaders, sticklebacks prefer to follow individuals whose personality matches their own, but bolder individuals may, nevertheless, be able to impose their leadership, even among shy followers, simply through greater effort.” We may soon see if such tendencies also hold true in humans, when Americans decide who they’ll follow in November.`

    topic: 'Renovation of Paris',
    transcript: [
      `Cities are interesting places. Some cities are carefully planned, built for a reason and reflects the needs of the people as it grows. Others are less conscientiously designed. Paris, for example, was originall founded in the 3rd century as a small village. And with every passing generation, it grew in size and importance. It grew from a medieval city to a modern city.`, `But the transition was not always smooth. Emperor Napoleon III had to hire someone to oversee the rebuilding of Paris. The man he chose was Georges-Eugène Haussmann. In 1853, Haussmann began the process of renovating France’s capital city. His basic instruction was to bring light and air into the central districts, improve the sanitation in living areas, and make Paris a more modern, beautiful city.`, `… Haussmann’s projects included the destruction of the old, medieval neighborhoods, whitening of streets, building large parks and public squares and addition of fountains and sewer lines. To add to all of this, the size of Paris had to be increased, doubled actually. And Napoleon III issued official decrees annexing nearby suburbs to make them part of the city. One of the main priorities of this massive renovation was to connect all the districts together. If we think of Paris as a house, each district was its own room, existing essentially independently of the other districts. Napoleon III wanted it to be easier to travel between the most important district and decreed a sense of this being one unified city, not a serious of independent neighborhoods. So Haussmann created large avenues that connected the districts. More than that, he made all of the avenues look roughly the same. Buildings on a major avenue were required to be roughly the same height and style, and even had to use the same cream color stone for the façade. The result was to remove any local characteristics and create a uniformed Paris. For the first time, the city had a specific look. A style that people began to associate not with a district, but with Paris itself.`

    topic: 'Musical Instrument',
    transcript: [`The Skoog is a new university assessable musical instrument. It is designed for use by children or adults with special needs or in fact be used by anyone. It's soft; it's easy to play; it's robust; and it can be customized to suit anyone’s abilities. The school helps students with special needs by allowing them to get involved in making music themselves. It’s new instrument that they can play and they can take ownership of and start creating their own sounds and music. Traditional instruments are the shape and size and made of the materials they are because of the sound that they need to make. If you want to make a sound like a plucked string you need a string and it needs to be under tension, whereas with the Skoog, because it's a mixture of software and a sensor, then the computer can handle making the sound, so we can design an object that’s designed to be touched and designed to be played with. In developing the Skoog we are actually working with kids in the schools and in the classroom. It’s really helped us make the Skoogs something that’s usable by the children themselves. They’ve informed us massively on how it needs to work and they’ve given their opinion on colors and design. And the feedback they’ve given to us has been marvellous. It's just so enriching and it's really inspiring to actually work with kids, particularly when you can provide them with an ability to start playing their own music as opposed to just taking part through listening and listening to other
    musicians and really learning from them.`],

It is the size of a pea in your brain. Decartes called it “the seat of soul”, and it is where melatonin is made. And it has a rhythm as well. And in the sense, it is the opposite of cortisol. It peaks at night. We call it as the darkness hormone. In every species that we studied, melatonin occurs at night. And it's a hormone that prepares you for the things, that your species, does at night. So, of course, in humans we sleep, but animals, like rodents, they are awake.

    topic: 'Frank Gehry ',
    transcript: [
      `So, continuing our series of lectures on Modernism, we now turn to architecture and, in particular, to the work of Frank O. Gehry. Now, I'm not going to go into his career in detail; it is enough to say that early on he was, like other modernist architects, tied to the rectangle, the straight line, and so on. Often their buildings would have this basic shape and they would just, urn…, add bits of decoration like splashes of color or pointless balconies. Soon enough, Gehry wanted to break away from straight lines and grid like designs. He wanted the freedom to experiment with other shapes, curves and unusually-angled roofs. What helped him with this was the computer, which allowed him to visualize and experiment with complex shapes, and to work on the whole design as one piece, without the added decoration being thrown in as an afterthought. Architecture as art, if you like ... or, or sculpture even. He himself said that he had struggled with crossing the line between architecture and sculpture. Now, I want to talk about one building in particular ... urn ... the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, which I think you'll agree is a masterpiece.`

    topic: 'Edmund Wilson',
    transcript: [
      `Wilson came the from a different world. And he became the focal point of a broad mainstream American culture that thought that modern literature and wanted modern literature to be able to be read and appreciated by ordinary people. They were not modernists in an abstract sense. And certainly, some of them like TS Eliot and Faulkner were too difficult for some of their writings to be read by ordinary people. But this was a world before the division between the brows or between a lead or whatever had established itself as a part of our consciousness. Wilson was a major player in the successful effort of his generation to establish at the heart of American life and innovative literature that would equal the great cultures of Europe. And he knew that the great cultures of Europe were there. He was not a product of a narrow American Studies kind of training at all. He joined a high artistic standard with an openness to all experience and a belief that literature was as much of a part of life for everyone as conversation. He thought the Proust and Joyce and Yeats and Eliot could and should be read by ordinary Americans and helped that to happen. Wilson was a very various man. Over a period of almost 50 years, he was a dedicated, a literary journalist, and an investigative reporter, a brilliant memoirist and dedicated journal keeper. (His biography, biographical histories to the Finland station and patriotic gore are profoundly influential with Americans today.`

    topic: 'Early Robots',
    transcript: [
      `This is a kind of object that you're probably all familiar with When you had the term robot, but I'm gonna show you the very, very first robots. These were the very first robots. They were characters in a play in the 1920s called Rossum's Universal Robots, and they…, the play was written by Czech writer called Karel Capek. And basically, these robots, you know, people tend to think of robots as kind of cute cuddly toys or, you know, Hollywood depictions kind of devoid of politics. But the first robots were actually created and imagined in a time of absolute political turmoil. You just had the First World War, you know, it finished and had a devastating impact across Europe and so people will kind… and people are kind of reflecting on “What does it mean to be human”, “what makes us human” those kinds 
      of question. And this kind of context is what inspired Capek to kind of write this play. And interestingly, these robots being human, they are actually in the play assembled on a production line, a bit like the Ford manufacturing production line. So even though they are human, they are assembled and these robots are designed to labour, and that is their primary purpose in society.`

      `I marvel at how often powerful fill powerless. But in the face of the defense of this empowerment there's no decline in involvement in organizations which seek to share wealth and opportunities which seek to protect one another's rights and work towards the common good. According to the UN, civil society groups have grown 40 fold since the turn of the last century, sorry since the turn of the last century. Internationally the nonprofit sector is worth one trillion dollars there are 700,000 not-for-profit organizations in Australia alone, 700,000. UN recognizes 37,000 specifically civil society organizations across the globe working in international relief and gives accreditation to many of them. This profound movement towards harnessing voices and resources from outside the realm of government and officialdom reflects a growth in trust, "the third sector NGOs".

      `Honey bees do a waggle dance to direct other bees to sources of nectar. But dancing bees like this one can be halted by a head butt from another bee. Now researches have found that this head butt is actually a warning signal. A feeding station was set up in the lab to mimic a source of nectar. Then foraging bees were introduced to the dangers at the station such as competition from rival colonies. When foragers returned to the hive, they stopped bee’s dancing. Scientist think the behavior warns dancers of a dangerous source of nectar.`

      `Welsh is a Celtic language spoken in Wales by about 740,000 people, and in the Welsh colony in Patagonia, Argentina by several hundred people. There are also Welsh speakers in England, Scotland, Canada, the USA, Australia and New Zealand. At the beginning of the 20th century about half of the population of Wales spoke Welsh as an everyday language. Towards the end of the century, the proportion of Welsh speakers had fallen to about 20%. According to the 2001 census 582,368 people can speak Welsh, 659,301 people can either speak, read or write Welsh, and 797,717 people, 28% of the population, claimed to have some knowledge of the 
      language. According to a survey carried out by S4C, the Welsh language TV channel, the number of Welsh speakers in Wales is around 750,000, and about 1.5 million people can 'understand' Welsh. In addition, there are an estimated 133,000 Welsh speakers living in England, about 50,000 of them in the Greater London area.`

      `In our survey, over a hundred CEOs who had recently been through an acquisition or merger were asked which areas of their activities needed the most effort. As you can see, the most frequent response to this question was that information technology requires the most effort. According to 58% of those we surveyed, IT was the most time-consuming and needed the most work. This is understandable as many of the IT issues are extremely complex and the consequences of any change in IT can have a significant impact. The key is how quickly and effectively IT integration can be achieved. And there has to be a clear understanding of the consequences there may be of not getting it right. The two other areas requiring significant attention: sales, marketing and business development on the one hand, and financial management on the other both were selected by 49% of the respondents.`

      `I believe our borders should be open. But if that is not politically acceptable for now, Europe should at least open up a legal route for people from developing countries to come work here. Over time, hopefully, we can move to a position where borders are completely open. Persuading sceptics won't be easy. That’s why I think the argument for free migration has to be made at several levels. A principled case, it increases freedom and reduces injustice. A humanitarian case, it helps people much poorer than ourselves. An economic case, it makes us richer. And a pragmatic case, it is inevitable, so it is in everyone’s interests to make the best of it. Freedom of movement is not just a matter of human rights and international solidarity. It is in our self-interest. Opening our borders may seem unrealistic. But so too, once did abolishing slavery or giving women the vote. Campaigning for people’s right to vote freely is a noble cause for our time.`

    transcript: [
      `But when we move into working with communities, we have to recognize that the communities have to be the authority in their language. Actually, a woman in the class I'm teaching at Sydney at the moment, a career woman, expressed this very nicely, although she was talking about something else. She was distinguishing expertise from authority. And certainly linguists because of our training we do have expertise in certain very narrow areas of language, but we don't have the authority over what to do with that knowledge or what to do with other knowledge that the community produces. I guess for me the bottom line is languages are lost because of the dominance of one people over another. That's not rocket science. It's not hard to work that out. But then what that means is if in working with language revival we continue to hold the authority, we actually haven't done anything towards undoing how languages are lost in the first place, so in a sense, the languages are still lost if the authority is still lost. `

    topic: 'Green Revolution and Rice',
    transcript: [
      `In 1943, what became known as the Green Revolution began when Mexico, unable to feed its growing population, shouted for help. Within a few years, the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations founded the International Rice Research Institute in Asia, and by 1962, a new strain of rice called IR8 was feeding people all over the world. IR8 was the first really big modified crop to make a real impact on world hunger. In 1962 the technology did not yet exist to directly manipulate the genes of plants, and so IR8 was created by carefully crossing existing varieties: selecting the best from each generation, further modifying them, and finally finding the best. Here is the power of modified crops: IR8, with no fertilizer, straight out of the box, produced five times the yield of traditional rice varieties. In optimal conditions with nitrogen, it produced ten times the yield of traditional varieties. By 1980, IR36 resisted pests and grew fast enough to allow two crops a year instead of just one, doubling the yield. And by 1990, using more advanced genetic manipulation techniques, IR72 was outperforming even IR36. The Green Revolution saw worldwide crop yields explode from 1960 through 2000.`

      `Today we're going to recount heroic tales of superhuman feats of strength, when in the face of disaster, some people are said to have summoned up incredible physical power to lift a car off of an accident victim, move giant rocks, or like Big John of song, single-handedly hold up a collapsing beam to let the other miners escape. Are such stories true? There are many anecdotes supporting the idea, but we're going to take a fact-based look at whether or not it truly is possible for an adrenalin-charged person to temporarily gain massive strength.`,
 
      `In proper terminology, such a temporary boost of physical power would be called hysterical strength. The stories are almost always in the form of one person lifting a car off of another. And even lifting many cars by several inches still leaves most of its weight supported by the suspension springs. But our purpose today is not to "debunk" any of the specific stories. The majority of them are anecdotal, and interestingly not repeatable; in many cases, the person who summoned the super strength later tried it again only to find that they couldn't do it.

    topic: 'Superhuman Strength',
    transcript: [
      `Today we're going to recount heroic tales of superhuman feats of strength, when in the face of disaster, some people are said to have summoned up incredible physical power to lift a car off of an accident victim, move giant rocks, or like Big John of song, single-handedly hold up a collapsing beam to let the other miners escape. Are such stories true? There are many anecdotes supporting the idea, but we're going to take a fact-based look at whether or not it truly is possible for an adrenalin-charged person to temporarily gain massive strength.`, 
      `In proper terminology, such a temporary boost of physical power would be called hysterical strength. The stories are almost always in the form of one person lifting a car off of another. And even lifting many cars by several inches still leaves most of its weight supported by the suspension springs. But our purpose today is not to "debunk" any of the specific stories. The majority of them are anecdotal, and interestingly not repeatable; in many cases, the person who summoned the super strength later tried it again only to find that they couldn't do it. Basically, what we have is a respectably large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests that in times of crisis, danger, or fear, some people have the ability to temporarily exercise superhuman strength. `

    topic: 'Taxonomy',
    transcript: [
      `Welcome to today's lesson. We’re continuing with our study of taxonomy. Taxonomy is how scientists classify organisms into different groups based on the characteristics that they share. So, for instance, a good way to think about taxonomy is the US Postal Service. If we want to send a letter to someone, we first start off by addressing it to the nation they are in. By default, we usually assume that’s America but it doesn't have to be, could be England or Costa Rica or Spain. You put their nation or their kingdom. Then within that kingdom, you address it to a slightly more specific level, their states. So, for instance, South Carolina would be the same as a phylum. And within that state, you would address it to their city and then to their street number, the street they live on. Then you would address it to say their apartment complex and within that complex, you'd address it by their last name to their family and then finally their first name to the specific person you want to get it to, and in that way, we’re able to weed out all the 400 million people we don't want to send our letter to in America and pinpoint the exact person we want the letter to reach. And in the same way scientists use a taxonomy chart to pinpoint a living creature and organism and how it relates to everything else in the world.`

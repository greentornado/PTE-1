    transcript: `For four centuries after the Viking <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank0"> <span class='answer hidden'>declined</span>, the people of the Shetland Islands off the north coast of Scotland continued to sell their goods through the North European Hanseatic League. The Hansa merchant bought shiploads of <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank1"> <span class='answer hidden'>salted</span> fish and in return the islanders got cash, grain, cloth and other goods. This lasted until the Act of Union between Scotland and England in 1707. This Act prohibited the Hansa merchant from <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank2"> <span class='answer hidden'>trading</span> with Scotland. Consequently Shetland went into an economic <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank3"> <span class='answer hidden'>depression</span>. The independent farmers of Shetland had to sell their land and were then <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank4"> <span class='answer hidden'>obligated</span> to pay rent, eventually becoming serfs.`,

    transcript: `<span class="text-highlight">The human right acts</span> can be seen as far reaching as <span class="text-highlight">controversial in the UK history of rights</span>, at the same times it can be described as some more <span class="text-highlight">cautious document</span> that provide <span class="text-highlight">a starting point for wider application for law to rights</span>. In many ways the <span class="text-highlight">freedom protection</span> contains <span class="text-highlight">within the human rights act</span> were <span class="text-highlight">not new to people living in the UK</span>. The act presents to the UK law, most of the clauses the European conventional human rights. The convention itself was divides following the end of the Second World War by the council of beau. UK lawyers played <span class="text-highlight">a significant role in the drafting of the convention</span> and the UK was among the first governments to rectify the convention in 1951. Rights are sometimes described as being of a positive or a negative nature but to say some can be express as a right too and others are a freedom from. The 1988 act puts into place 15 specific crimes in freedoms which includes rights to limited security, a free trial, free expression, free elections and the right to marry into family to family. There are also <span class="text-highlight">freedoms from torture</span>, <span class="text-highlight">from slavery</span> or <span class="text-highlight">force labour</span> and <span class="text-highlight">from discrimination</span> grounds such as race, sex, religion, political opinion or social origin. The human right acts has been described as <span class="text-highlight">the start of a process</span>, the act itself does not expand on the provisions made by the European convention, which some of consider as holding <span class="text-highlight">a baseline or a minimum standard of the human rights</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about the history of human rights, which can be described as a starting point for wider application in the UK. He also indicated that the freedom protection within the Human Right Act included freedoms from torture, from slavery and from discrimination. He emphasized that UK lawyers played a significant role in the drafting of the convention and the UK was the first governments to rectify it. _(69 words)_`,

    topic: "London Architecture",
    transcript: `It seems to me that <span class="text-highlight">architecture</span> is very much something that <span class="text-highlight">causes it both pleasure and trouble</span>. I'm from a part of West London, where I feel that many of the streets where I live really, really ugly. And this distresses me every time I walk into a supermarket or walk to the tube and think, god why did they build that? And <span class="text-highlight">terrible problem with architecture</span> is that it <span class="text-highlight">last so long</span>, if you write a bad book or do a bad play, you know it’ll have a short run and then be shelved and no one will suffer, a <span class="text-highlight">bad building</span> as a <span class="text-highlight">serious impact</span> for, could be hundreds of years, <span class="text-highlight">on the people around it</span> and um especially the book a rose a little bit of frustration was anger. There was so many bad architecture around and then I realized when you talk to architectures and you say um why building not more beautiful, they’ll say ‘Ma, how you use such a word as beauty, that’s a really arrogant word. No one knows what beautiful, it’s all <span class="text-highlight">in the eyes of the beholder</span>.’ I couldn’t help but think that actually, well you know, we all tend to agree that in Rome is nicer than Milton Keynes and that San Francisco has the edge of Frankfurt Tyfull. You may ask for generalization, surely there are something’s we can say about <span class="text-highlight">why a building works and why it doesn’t</span>. So, the book is already in an attempted to suggest <span class="text-highlight">why architectures works</span> <span class="text-highlight">when it does</span> and <span class="text-highlight">what might be going wrong</span> <span class="text-highlight">when it doesn’t work</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about the concept of architecture that causes both pleasure and trouble. He firstly indicated that a poorly designed building has serious impacts on the people around it. He strongly agreed that there was so much bad architecture and emphasized terrible problems with architecture as it lasts longer than a bad book or a bad play. He finally introduced a book to suggest why and how architecture works. _(70 words)_`,

    topic: "Big Bang",
    transcript: `One of the <span class="text-highlight">most amazing things that’s happened</span> even in my lifetime is the <span class="text-highlight">prediction of cosmology</span>. When I started out forty odd years ago, we thought we knew that <span class="text-highlight">the universe began a big bang</span> , some people doubted even then. We thought <span class="text-highlight">the universe</span> was about ten or twenty billion years old but now for really very sound <span class="text-highlight">scientific reasons</span> we can say that the universe did started in a Big bang and it’s 13.8 billion years old so it’s not 14, its not 13 because <span class="text-highlight">a decimal point in there</span> and that’s a <span class="text-highlight">stunning achievement</span> to know that. And we also know that the <span class="text-highlight">laws of physical</span> that apply to <span class="text-highlight">tiny particles inside atoms</span> also <span class="text-highlight">explains what happened in the big bang</span> you can’t have one without the other. A very neat example of this is that when you apply <span class="text-highlight">nuclear physics</span>, that kind of physics to understand <span class="text-highlight">how stars work</span>, you find out that the oldest star in the universe is about 13 billion years old. So their universe is just a little bit older than the stars. Fantastic, if we done it and counted in the other way around and said that the stars were older than the universe, we would say <span class="text-highlight">science</span> were in deep trouble. But it’s not, everything fits together and we know <span class="text-highlight">how the universe began</span>, we got to know how the way it is. The future that it ‘ll suspects we don’t know quiet well what’s going, but we got some ideas, which are as good as those ideas we had 40 years ago about <span class="text-highlight">how big bang happened</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about the prediction of cosmology which is one of the most amazing things that happened in his lifetime. He firstly had a discussion about a stunning achievement to know that the Universe did start in a Big Bang and it is 13.8 billion years old. In addition, he emphasized the laws of physics explaining what happened in the Big Bang helped scientists know exactly how the universe began. _(70 words)_`,

    topic: "Danger of keeping drugs at home",
    transcript: `“But what are the <span class="text-highlight">dangers of keeping these drugs</span> at home?”
    “There are a number of dangers. Parents should know that <span class="text-highlight">leftover drugs are dangerous</span> because they may be <span class="text-highlight">accidentally ingested by children</span>. Either adults don’t keep the bottles properly closed and stored or because even many kids can sometimes open childproof lids. <span class="text-highlight">Patients may use the drugs after their expiration date</span>. The leftover drugs may be <span class="text-highlight">taken for the wrong reasons</span>. For example, someone may have a <span class="text-highlight">viral infection</span> and <span class="text-highlight">self-prescribed</span> to left over into microbial that was prescribed for a bacterial infection. But that drug will have no effect as the viral infections. Drugs that are left over might be given to or taken by someone else who may have a <span class="text-highlight">serious allergy</span> to the medicine and who for that reason would not be prescribed to medicine under the supervision of a physician. Finally, <span class="text-highlight">inappropriate use of drugs promotes drug resistance</span> if the drug is <span class="text-highlight">taken for the wrong indication, the wrong duration, or in the wrong dosage</span>.
    “Todd, what can people do about this how can the situation be improved?”
    “I think <span class="text-highlight">physicians, patients and parents of patients</span> can take steps to <span class="text-highlight">improve the situation</span>. First of all, physicians should <span class="text-highlight">prescribe the drug only when appropriate</span>, only in the <span class="text-highlight">correct amount</span> and only for the <span class="text-highlight">correct duration</span>. Also, the physician must <span class="text-highlight">stress to the patient</span> that the <span class="text-highlight">full course of the drug must be taken</span>. This is recommended <span class="text-highlight">even if symptoms resolved before the end of the prescription</span> and parents of children on antibiotics need to ensure they complete their course as well.”`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about the dangers of keeping drugs. He indicated that leftover drugs are dangerous because they may be accidentally taken by children. In addition, patients may use their drugs after their expiration date and the leftover drugs may be taken for the wrong decision. Finally, he strongly recommended that both patients and their parents can take important steps to improve the situation of the inappropriate use of drugs. _(70 words)_`,

    transcript: `The time in late ninety-nineties when <span class="text-highlight">management consultants</span> wrote books with titles such as ‘<span class="text-highlight">The war for talent</span>’, there was a great deal of talk about the <span class="text-highlight">talent wars</span>. Then I think there was the <span class="text-highlight">bursting of the bubble</span> with the bursting of the dark karma book and a sense of the people who had been <span class="text-highlight">masters of the universe</span> just a few weeks before were out on the streets looking for jobs. I think this created a <span class="text-highlight">reaction</span>, it gave me ideas of that <span class="text-highlight">there was a war for talent</span>, in fact all of the things were saw in late ninety-nineties are <span class="text-highlight">reasserting</span> themselves now, all those shortages are reasserting themselves and the real reason the audit was really the bursting of the bubble not the <span class="text-highlight">shortages of talent</span>. There are very <span class="text-highlight">profound structural forces</span>, which are created these talent shortages. One is the fact that <span class="text-highlight">the</span>nature of the economy<span class="text-highlight">is changing</span>; it’s putting more and <span class="text-highlight">more premium upon intellectual skills</span>, <span class="text-highlight">analytical skills</span>, <span class="text-highlight">creative skills</span>, which <span class="text-highlight">are in short supply</span> so there is a demand increase but there is also a <span class="text-highlight">decrease incline</span>. Because we’re seeing now the <span class="text-highlight">age of baby pool</span> the <span class="text-highlight">shirking of population</span> in Europe, Japan and not very long in China as well and the sort of stabilization that the population of the United States. So we see a time when there is a greater demand for <span class="text-highlight">intellectual skills</span> and slowing down in the supple of people who possess those skills and also a <span class="text-highlight">mismatch between the sort of things that people are learning at school</span>, when university and the sort of things the economy is placing a premium on, particularly with the <span class="text-highlight">shortage of trained people in the sciences and engineering</span> so for all sort of reasons there’s a <span class="text-highlight">premium on talent</span>.`,

We welcome you to this terrific day and <span class="text-highlight">this conference</span> on <span class="text-highlight">educational leadership</span>, this is something relatively unheard of an <span class="text-highlight">higher education</span>, I think where a business school gets together with an <span class="text-highlight">education school</span> and talks about education leadership. The other purpose of Stanford University is to promote learning; <span class="text-highlight">the purpose of school education is to promote learning about education</span>, <span class="text-highlight">the purpose of the business school is to promote learning about management</span>. Most of the world’s businesses services are delivered by <span class="text-highlight">managed instincts institutions</span>, that are <span class="text-highlight">for-profit managed institutions, not-for-profit managed institutions</span>. We rely on the managed institutions that’s our <span class="text-highlight">chosen instrument society</span> to get things done and implement services, particularly educational services which is done by people on their own. The quality of which is done, the performance that underlies how that ever takes place is perfect and we think that in a school of business, the school management has a lot to do with management. The people who <span class="text-highlight">take responsibility</span> for the results, a tremendous sense of worship were saying that they get accomplished and that the work that must be done through other people is in fact done and that there is a capability also by the mangers and people that they feel responsible for.`,

    No. Left and right in politics <span class="text-highlight">comes from the original designation of the Deputies</span> who sat to the

Essentially it's a showing of <span class="text-highlight">how well the Australian economy has been doing over the last 15 years</span>. We have had 15 years, more or less of uninterrupted and economic growth during which <span class="text-highlight">average earnings</span> have risen by close to &nbsp;90%. While over the course of that period the <span class="text-highlight">standard variable mortgage rate has roughly halved</span>.

Over the same period <span class="text-highlight">rising immigration</span> and <span class="text-highlight">falling average household size</span> have meant that the <span class="text-highlight">number households looking for accommodation has risen</span> by about <span class="text-highlight">one and a half million</span>, that's around 200 thousand more than the number of dwellings has increased by. So you have had a <span class="text-highlight">substantial increase</span> in the <span class="text-highlight">purchasing power of households</span>, no net increase in the supply of housing and hence all that addition purchasing power has gone into <span class="text-highlight">pushing up the price of housing</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about the main reason why Australian housing is expensive. She firstly introduced many concepts including economic growth, average earnings, mortgage rate, immigration issues, and home buying households who afford to borrow money. Additionally, she explained that the number of households looking for accommodations has significantly increased over the period of time. Finally, she concluded that purchasing power is the main factor pushing up the price of housing.  _(70 words)_`,

    topic: "Language Death",
    transcript: `<span class="text-highlight">Language death is not a mainstream theatre</span>. It is not mainstream anything. Can you imagine Hollywood taking it on? It is so far <span class="text-highlight">outside the mindsets of most people</span> that they have a difficulty appreciating what the crisis is all about because they are not used to thinking more about language as an issue in itself. Somehow, we need to change these mindsets. We need to <span class="text-highlight">get people thinking more about language more explicitly</span>, <span class="text-highlight">more intimately</span>, <span class="text-highlight">more enthusiastically</span>. Interest in language is certainly there, in the general population. Most people <span class="text-highlight">are fascinated by such topics</span> as <span class="text-highlight">where words come from</span>, or <span class="text-highlight">what the origin of their town’s name is</span>, or <span class="text-highlight">whether their baby’s name means anything</span>; they are certainly prepared to play Scrabble and a host of other language games and infinitum; and you get language games on radio and television too – but a <span class="text-highlight">willingness</span> to focus that interest on general issues, a <span class="text-highlight">preparedness to take on board the emotion</span> and <span class="text-highlight">drama inherent in the situation of language endangerment</span>, <span class="text-highlight">is not something that happens much</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about language death which is not a mainstream theatre. In addition, he emphasized the importance of changing humans’ mindsets about languages. He suggested that people should think about language more explicitly, more intimately and more enthusiastically. Although people are interested in many language topics, they lack a willingness to focus and a preparedness to take on board the drama inherent in the situation of language endangerment. _(69 words)_`,

In 1901, she moved to Manhattan, where members of the family for whom she worked developed fevers and diarrhea, and the laundress died. Mallon then went to work for a lawyer; she left after seven of the eight people in that household became ill. <br/><br/> In 1906, she took a position in Oyster Bay, Long Island, and within two weeks 10 of the 11 family members were hospitalized with typhoid. <span class="text-highlight">She changed jobs</span> again, and similar occurrences happened in three more households. She worked as a cook for the family of a wealthy New York banker, Charles Henry Warren. When the Warrens rented a house in Oyster Bay for the summer of 1906, Mallon went along too.

I think there is <span class="text-highlight">an intense competition</span> at the moment to hire <span class="text-highlight">the most talented</span> and <span class="text-highlight">the most intellectually able people</span>. There is a time when I think companies had many of the adventures in the world, that it was the company's world, it will be the bosses’ world. Now, I think the reverse is the case. We have <span class="text-highlight">a shortage of talent</span> both within countries and between countries: have <span class="text-highlight">intense battle between companies</span> trying to hire the most talented workers and also between countries which are looking to recruit <span class="text-highlight">talented young people</span>, <span class="text-highlight">talented young immigrants</span>. We have these senses of immigrants being things that countries are battling to keep out and immigrants trying to get in, climb over the walls. I think the opposite is, in fact, the case. And the topic is that countries are trying to woo bright young people to get them to go to the universities and get them to become immigrants. So, on many, many levels, time that is a premium, there is a shortage of talent. And so, <span class="text-highlight">countries, companies, all sorts of organizations</span>, of course, voluntary organization as well as are competing to <span class="text-highlight">hire the best and the brightest</span>. You know, we have <span class="text-highlight">a baby boomer population which is aging</span>. We have <span class="text-highlight">an economy which is becoming more sophisticated</span>.

    transcript: `I'm trying here to capture the dynamic that just conventionally been associated with <span class="text-highlight">urbanization development</span>. And it gets back once again to this question of <span class="text-highlight">agriculture</span>. Once you have cities you also as a reflection of cities, you have the countryside, you have <span class="text-highlight">rural areas</span> that have this relationship with <span class="text-highlight">urban areas</span> and at mediated by the production of <span class="text-highlight">agricultural goods</span>. And then the trade of those are increasingly <span class="text-highlight">industrial goods</span>. Increasing an agricultural productivity <span class="text-highlight">reduces labour needs and opportunities in rural areas</span>, pushing people towards the city's. There's this notion that in order to have progress and developments in cities, you need people. If everybody is busy growing crops, growing food to simply subsist, you can have people going into the city, you need to <span class="text-highlight">increase productivity in the countryside</span>. You need to have one farmer produce enough food more than one family. And then you will have growth and productivity in the countryside which will free up people to move to the cities. In fact, in many ways, it will compel them to <span class="text-highlight">move to the cities</span> because they won't be able to make a living in the countryside anymore. They will go to the cities <span class="text-highlight">in search of jobs</span> and provide <span class="text-highlight">a labour force</span> for <span class="text-highlight">the production of all kinds of other things</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about the dynamic that conventionally associated with urbanization development. He firstly indicated that an increase in agricultural productivities can reduce labour needs and opportunities in rural areas, then this may push people towards the city.

They can <span class="text-highlight">buy a lifetime of experience with that brand</span>, they can buy with whatever it’s designed to deal with, all of which makes them feel: <span class="text-highlight">performance and price</span>.

So <span class="text-highlight">brands are essential to our business to allow us to deliver the increased consumer value associated with our products</span>.<br/> But we're not into the <span class="text-highlight">generic business of toilet paper</span>, we're into probably about the <span class="text-highlight">softest product</span> you're going to want to buy. We're not into a generic soap, we're into the best, you know, stain removing laundry detergent you're going to buy. But we're going to want you to remember that as the tide brand, now, that means there's a second moment of truth. If they do select you and they pay 50% more than they want to pay for Walmart's brand when they get home, it’d better perform when it's used. And here's where the science starts, folks. There's an amazing <span class="text-highlight">number of fundamental engineering contradictions</span>, right?<br/>
      Airplanes deal with you know, <span class="text-highlight">weight and strength</span>. I want something that's <span class="text-highlight">light, but strong</span>. That's an engineering contradiction.<br/>

So take a look at these four panels.

So <span class="text-highlight">one of the most profound things biology has taught us is all life on earth is exceptionally related and similar to one on one to another</span>.

They're all based on cells <span class="text-highlight">cells are the fundamental building blocks of all life</span>.

But I want to try and draw some kind of generalities from that in terms of how there's <span class="text-highlight">a series of curatorial practices</span>, if you like <span class="text-highlight">tools and techniques and methods</span> that I think could be of interest to your students and of interest to you in <span class="text-highlight">developing extension history courses</span>. So <span class="text-highlight">curators try to understand material culture</span> is evidence of other people's lives as a means to try to understand other people, <span class="text-highlight">what they look like what they did</span>, <span class="text-highlight">how they made a living</span>, <span class="text-highlight">what they hope for in their lives</span>, <span class="text-highlight">how they tried to construct the world</span>, and <span class="text-highlight">why they made particular choices</span>. And one way in which you're a supermodel historians is therefore in focus in terms of <span class="text-highlight">how we interrogate the past</span>, <span class="text-highlight">what elements we use to communicate in the past</span>. Most <span class="text-highlight">academic historians</span>, I trained very much in discipline of words, and they concentrate on words still today. I think all that's changing a little bit. If you go through university history, I think primarily you are encouraged to draw on things like <span class="text-highlight">archival accounts</span>, <span class="text-highlight">manuscripts</span>. Now <span class="text-highlight">oral history</span>, <span class="text-highlight">historians</span>, oral histories, and <span class="text-highlight">most of that work is actually promulgated in the form of books</span>. There's also other kinds of storeys obviously, <span class="text-highlight">filmmaker photographers concentrate on creating images of the world and arranging them in meaningful sequences</span>, but <span class="text-highlight">curators attend to objects</span>. <span class="text-highlight">We look at objects as evidence of the past, and try to arrange objects in meaningful ways called exhibitions</span>.`,

    transcript: `What makes you itch? What sort of a <span class="text-highlight">situation</span>? Would you like?
    Let's suppose I do this often in <span class="text-highlight">vocational guidance</span> of students. They come to me and say, well, we're <span class="text-highlight">getting out of college</span> and we have the <span class="text-highlight">faintest idea</span> what we want to do. So I always ask the <span class="text-highlight">question</span>, what would you like to do if <span class="text-highlight">money</span> were <span class="text-highlight">no object</span>? What would How would you really <span class="text-highlight">enjoy spending your life?</span> Well, it's so amazing as a result of our kind of <span class="text-highlight">educational system</span>. Crowds of students say, Well, we'd like to be <span class="text-highlight">painters</span>, we'd like to be <span class="text-highlight">poets</span>. We'd like to be <span class="text-highlight">writers</span>, but as everybody knows, you can't done any money that way. Or another person says, Well, I'd like to<span class="text-highlight">live an outdoors life</span> and <span class="text-highlight">ride horses</span>.
    I said you want to teach in riding school?
    Let's go through with it. <span class="text-highlight">What do you want</span>?
    When we finally got down with something which the individual says he <span class="text-highlight">really wants to do</span>?
    I will say to him, you do that? And <span class="text-highlight">forget</span> the money. Because if you say that <span class="text-highlight">getting the money</span> is the <span class="text-highlight">most important</span>. You will <span class="text-highlight">spend your life</span> <span class="text-highlight">completely</span> <span class="text-highlight">wasting</span> your <span class="text-highlight">time</span>. You'll be <span class="text-highlight">doing things</span> you <span class="text-highlight">don't like doing</span> in order to <span class="text-highlight">go on living</span> that is to go on doing things you don't like doing.`,
    solution: `The lecturer raised many questions about what students would like to do if money were not the object. He introduced a few examples to demonstrate why students need to enjoy spending their life with the career they actually like. He argued that if people think money is the most important part, they may completely waste their time. He finally concluded that students should follow their dream and forget the money. _(70 words)_.`,

    topic: "Wildlife in Africa",
    transcript: `In my view, it's impossible to talk about <span class="text-highlight">wildlife</span> and not think about it roughly in 9 years. And I guess part of that is my own <span class="text-highlight">angle</span> and part of the research that I do in <span class="text-highlight">Africa</span>, in both East and West Africa, I look at the role of the <span class="text-highlight">human reliance</span> on wildlife as a <span class="text-highlight">source of food</span>, and also as a <span class="text-highlight">source of income.</span> Can we talk about our wildlife <span class="text-highlight">at sea</span> and we talk about <span class="text-highlight">fish</span>, we're talking about what's probably the <span class="text-highlight">single most important</span> <span class="text-highlight">source of protein</span>for <span class="text-highlight">humans</span> <span class="text-highlight">across the globe</span>. So, millions for more than a billion people <span class="text-highlight">rely on fish</span> is their <span class="text-highlight">primary source</span> of <span class="text-highlight">animal protein</span>. And most of these people are living in <span class="text-highlight">poverty</span>. So, the <span class="text-highlight">management</span> of fish resources, wildlife in that sense is of course <span class="text-highlight">incredibly important</span> and livelihoods and health. And also, <span class="text-highlight">wildlife tourism</span> is a multi billion <span class="text-highlight">dollar industry</span> and in many <span class="text-highlight">countries</span>, such as Africa and <span class="text-highlight">South America</span>, and it can be the <span class="text-highlight">number one source of income</span>. It can be the <span class="text-highlight">number one</span> source of <span class="text-highlight">foreign income</span> for <span class="text-highlight">economies</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about wildlife in Africa and the role of human reliance on wildlife as a source of food and income. He firstly argued that many people relying on fish as the primary source of protein are living in poverty. In addition, he suggested that management of fish resources is incredibly important. He finally concluded that wildlife tourism can be the number one source of foreign income for economies. _(70 words)_.`,

    topic: "Human rights",
    transcript: `<span class="text-highlight">The human right acts</span> can be seen as far reaching as <span class="text-highlight">controversial in the UK history of rights</span>, at the same times it can be described as some more <span class="text-highlight">cautious document</span> that provide <span class="text-highlight">a starting point for wider application for law to rights</span>. In many ways the <span class="text-highlight">freedom protection</span> contains <span class="text-highlight">within the human rights act</span> were <span class="text-highlight">not new to people living in the UK</span>. The act presents to the UK law, most of the clauses the European conventional human rights. The convention itself was divides following the end of the Second World War by the council of beau. UK lawyers played <span class="text-highlight">a significant role in the drafting of the convention</span> and the UK was among the first governments to rectify the convention in 1951. Rights are sometimes described as being of a positive or a negative nature but to say some can be express as a right too and others are a freedom from. The 1988 act puts into place 15 specific crimes in freedoms which includes rights to limited security, a free trial, free expression, free elections and the right to marry into family to family. There are also <span class="text-highlight">freedoms from torture</span>, <span class="text-highlight">from slavery</span> or <span class="text-highlight">force labour</span> and <span class="text-highlight">from discrimination</span> grounds such as race, sex, religion, political opinion or social origin. The human right acts has been described as <span class="text-highlight">the start of a process</span>, the act itself does not expand on the provisions made by the European convention, which some of consider as holding <span class="text-highlight">a baseline or a minimum standard of the human rights</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about the history of human rights, which can be described as a starting point for wider application in the UK. He also indicated that the freedom protection within the Human Right Act included freedoms from torture, from slavery and from discrimination. He emphasized that UK lawyers played a significant role in the drafting of the convention and the UK was the first governments to rectify it. _(69 words)_`,

    topic: "Washing Machines",
    transcript: `Here in the waggon barn are some of the <span class="text-highlight">most important inventions</span> in <span class="text-highlight">human history</span>. Sure, you can see <span class="text-highlight">examples</span> here of the wheel, or the <span class="text-highlight">automobile</span>. That the inventions I'm talking about are the <span class="text-highlight">domestic appliances</span> that <span class="text-highlight">allowed</span> for <span class="text-highlight">increased</span> <span class="text-highlight">leisure time</span>, and redefined <span class="text-highlight">gender roles</span> in <span class="text-highlight">society</span> to a degree as <span class="text-highlight">never seen before</span> in <span class="text-highlight">human history</span>. The <span class="text-highlight">evolution</span> of the <span class="text-highlight">washing machine</span>, as demonstrated in this barn is a <span class="text-highlight">representative example</span> of this <span class="text-highlight">changing domestic life</span>. For many centuries, <span class="text-highlight">sailors</span> used to place their clothing in a cloth bag, tie the back to a rope and throw it overboard, letting the ship drag it for hours. The principle was simple, force water through the clothes to remove the dirt. But in the household before running <span class="text-highlight">water</span> and <span class="text-highlight">electricity</span>,
    Washington close to a staggering amount of labour
    to <span class="text-highlight">wash</span>, boil and rent a single load of <span class="text-highlight">clothes</span> to take care gallons of water, which had to be hand carried from my pump or well, hand wringing, rubbing and lifting the clothes could <span class="text-highlight">expose</span> <span class="text-highlight">women</span> to <span class="text-highlight">caustic substances</span> in the setups. The whole <span class="text-highlight">process</span> for <span class="text-highlight">households laundry</span> could take an <span class="text-highlight">entire day</span> or more as back breaking labour, and 1846, a <span class="text-highlight">patented washing machine</span> imitated the <span class="text-highlight">human hand</span> moving cloth over a washboard by using a lever to rub the clothes between two red surfaces. This machine was sold in the US as late as 1927. The <span class="text-highlight">first electric clothes washers</span>, in which a motor rotated the tub were <span class="text-highlight">introduced into America</span> about 1900.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about washing machine, which is one of the most important inventions in human history. He firstly highlighted the importance of domestic appliances allowing for increased leisure time and redefining gender roles in society. Additionally, the evolution of the washing machine is a representative example of the domestic life. He finally explained the whole process for laundry could take an entire day and expose women to caustic substances. _(70 words)_`,

    topic: "Globalization and IT",
    transcript: `Well, I would argue that what they will say was the <span class="text-highlight">most important thing</span> to happen <span class="text-highlight">in the early 21st century</span> was the <span class="text-highlight">merger</span> of <span class="text-highlight">globalisation</span>. And the it <span class="text-highlight">revolution</span>. The two really <span class="text-highlight">fused in a way</span> that more and more it started to <span class="text-highlight">drive more and more globalisation</span>. And <span class="text-highlight">more and more</span> globalisation started to drive more and more it. And what that <span class="text-highlight">fusion</span> did was <span class="text-highlight">take the world</span> from <span class="text-highlight">connected</span> to <span class="text-highlight">hyperconnected</span> and from <span class="text-highlight">interconnected</span> to <span class="text-highlight">interdependent</span>. These are huge differences of degree that our <span class="text-highlight">differences</span> in kind. It happened over the last decade. You are all feeling it in your jobs, in your universities in your schools. But no one's really <span class="text-highlight">explaining</span> it to <span class="text-highlight">people</span>. Everyone's living. This fusion now the <span class="text-highlight">plumbing</span> of the world <span class="text-highlight">fundamentally changed</span> <span class="text-highlight">in the last</span> <span class="text-highlight">10 years</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about the merger of globalisation and IT revolution, which was the most important thing in the early twentieth-first century. He firstly explained that more IT started to drive more globalisation, and vice versa. Additionally, that fusion took the world from connected to hyperconnected, and from interconnected to interdependent. Finally, he concluded that this event happened over the last decade, but no one is explaining it to people. _(70 words)_`,

    topic: "“What makes you itch?”",
    transcript: `What makes you itch? What sort of a <span class="text-highlight">situation</span>? Would you like?
    Let's suppose I do this often in <span class="text-highlight">vocational guidance</span> of students. They come to me and say, well, we're <span class="text-highlight">getting out of college</span> and we have the <span class="text-highlight">faintest idea</span> what we want to do. So I always ask the <span class="text-highlight">question</span>, what would you like to do if <span class="text-highlight">money</span> were <span class="text-highlight">no object</span>? What would How would you really <span class="text-highlight">enjoy spending your life?</span> Well, it's so amazing as a result of our kind of <span class="text-highlight">educational system</span>. Crowds of students say, Well, we'd like to be <span class="text-highlight">painters</span>, we'd like to be <span class="text-highlight">poets</span>. We'd like to be <span class="text-highlight">writers</span>, but as everybody knows, you can't done any money that way. Or another person says, Well, I'd like to<span class="text-highlight">live an outdoors life</span> and <span class="text-highlight">ride horses</span>.
    I said you want to teach in riding school?
    Let's go through with it. <span class="text-highlight">What do you want</span>?
    When we finally got down with something which the individual says he <span class="text-highlight">really wants to do</span>?
    I will say to him, you do that? And <span class="text-highlight">forget</span> the money. Because if you say that <span class="text-highlight">getting the money</span> is the <span class="text-highlight">most important</span>. You will <span class="text-highlight">spend your life</span> <span class="text-highlight">completely</span> <span class="text-highlight">wasting</span> your <span class="text-highlight">time</span>. You'll be <span class="text-highlight">doing things</span> you <span class="text-highlight">don't like doing</span> in order to <span class="text-highlight">go on living</span> that is to go on doing things you don't like doing.`,
    solution: `The lecturer raised many questions about what students would like to do if money were not the object. He introduced a few examples to demonstrate why students need to enjoy spending their life with the career they actually like. He argued that if people think money is the most important part, they may completely waste their time. He finally concluded that students should follow their dream and forget the money. _(70 words)_.`,

    topic: "Wildlife in Africa",
    transcript: `In my view, it's impossible to talk about <span class="text-highlight">wildlife</span> and not think about it roughly in 9 years. And I guess part of that is my own <span class="text-highlight">angle</span> and part of the research that I do in <span class="text-highlight">Africa</span>, in both East and West Africa, I look at the role of the <span class="text-highlight">human reliance</span> on wildlife as a <span class="text-highlight">source of food</span>, and also as a <span class="text-highlight">source of income.</span> Can we talk about our wildlife <span class="text-highlight">at sea</span> and we talk about <span class="text-highlight">fish</span>, we're talking about what's probably the <span class="text-highlight">single most important</span> <span class="text-highlight">source of protein</span>for <span class="text-highlight">humans</span> <span class="text-highlight">across the globe</span>. So, millions for more than a billion people <span class="text-highlight">rely on fish</span> is their <span class="text-highlight">primary source</span> of <span class="text-highlight">animal protein</span>. And most of these people are living in <span class="text-highlight">poverty</span>. So, the <span class="text-highlight">management</span> of fish resources, wildlife in that sense is of course <span class="text-highlight">incredibly important</span> and livelihoods and health. And also, <span class="text-highlight"></span>wildlife tourism is a multi billion <span class="text-highlight">dollar industry</span> and in many <span class="text-highlight">countries</span>, such as Africa and <span class="text-highlight">South America</span>, and it can be the <span class="text-highlight">number one source of income</span>. It can be the <span class="text-highlight">number one</span> source of <span class="text-highlight">foreign income</span> for <span class="text-highlight">economies</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about wildlife in Africa and the role of human reliance on wildlife as a source of food and income. He firstly argued that many people relying on fish as the primary source of protein are living in poverty. In addition, he suggested that management of fish resources is incredibly important. He finally concluded that wildlife tourism can be the number one source of foreign income for economies. _(70 words)_.`,

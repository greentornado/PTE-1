    transcript: `<span class="text-highlight">The human right acts</span> can be seen as far reaching as <span class="text-highlight">controversial in the UK history of rights</span>, at the same times it can be described as some more <span class="text-highlight">cautious document</span> that provide <span class="text-highlight">a starting point for wider application for law to rights</span>. In many ways the <span class="text-highlight">freedom protection</span> contains <span class="text-highlight">within the human rights act</span> were <span class="text-highlight">not new to people living in the UK</span>. The act presents to the UK law, most of the clauses the European conventional human rights. The convention itself was divides following the end of the Second World War by the council of beau. UK lawyers played <span class="text-highlight">a significant role in the drafting of the convention</span> and the UK was among the first governments to rectify the convention in 1951. Rights are sometimes described as being of a positive or a negative nature but to say some can be express as a right too and others are a freedom from. The 1988 act puts into place 15 specific crimes in freedoms which includes rights to limited security, a free trial, free expression, free elections and the right to marry into family to family. There are also <span class="text-highlight">freedoms from torture</span>, <span class="text-highlight">from slavery</span> or <span class="text-highlight">force labour</span> and <span class="text-highlight">from discrimination</span> grounds such as race, sex, religion, political opinion or social origin. The human right acts has been described as <span class="text-highlight">the start of a process</span>, the act itself does not expand on the provisions made by the European convention, which some of consider as holding <span class="text-highlight">a baseline or a minimum standard of the human rights</span>.`,

    transcript: `It seems to me that <span class="text-highlight">architecture</span> is very much something that <span class="text-highlight">causes it both pleasure and trouble</span>. I'm from a part of West London, where I feel that many of the streets where I live really, really ugly. And this distresses me every time I walk into a supermarket or walk to the tube and think, god why did they build that? And <span class="text-highlight">terrible problem with architecture</span> is that it <span class="text-highlight">last so long</span>, if you write a bad book or do a bad play, you know it’ll have a short run and then be shelved and no one will suffer, a <span class="text-highlight">bad building</span> as a <span class="text-highlight">serious impact</span> for, could be hundreds of years, <span class="text-highlight">on the people around it</span> and um especially the book a rose a little bit of frustration was anger. There was so many bad architecture around and then I realized when you talk to architectures and you say um why building not more beautiful, they’ll say ‘Ma, how you use such a word as beauty, that’s a really arrogant word. No one knows what beautiful, it’s all <span class="text-highlight">in the eyes of the beholder</span>.’ I couldn’t help but think that actually, well you know, we all tend to agree that in Rome is nicer than Milton Keynes and that San Francisco has the edge of Frankfurt Tyfull. You may ask for generalization, surely there are something’s we can say about <span class="text-highlight">why a building works and why it doesn’t</span>. So, the book is already in an attempted to suggest <span class="text-highlight">why architectures works</span> <span class="text-highlight">when it does</span> and <span class="text-highlight">what might be going wrong</span> <span class="text-highlight">when it doesn’t work</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about the concept of architecture that causes both pleasure and trouble. He firstly indicated that a poorly designed building has serious impacts on the people around it. He strongly agreed that there were so much bad architecture and emphasized terrible problems with architecture as it lasts longer than a bad book or a bad play. He finally introduced a book to suggest why and how architecture works. _(70 words)_`,
